"Lots of clotting, and horrible periods."
I notice a poster attributed Bell's palsy to lipitor.
"After 3 days, same symptoms plus depression and mood swings."
"My doctor prescribed me a topical cream , did some vaginal test to exclude infections."
Statins can't be good for anyone but the drug companies!!!!!!!!!!

"After taking Lipitor for a year, I started having pain in my hip."

Stiffness was aggravated by rest and better with activity.
Within one day I felt the pain lessen.
Spoke to a psychiatrist and she confirmed that the entire family of Norvasc (called amlodiphine) is known to have psychiatric side effects.
MD's need to take their patients reports about Lipitor seriously.
Symptoms still persist 1 week later.

the drug has worked very well to resuce my cholesterol rating 5 however the pain in my arm and shoulder has reduced within 2 days of stopping the drug Rating 1 .
It took finding a web site to discover it was the Lipitor.
"I have a high tolerance for pain, so the pain wasn't an issue, but I feel like I've aged 20 years!"

I see my GP tomorrow for the results of my first 3 month blood test.
In other words the symptoms went away.
I only had a slight headache and shouldar ache today.
None that I know of.
"Better to live ten years feeling OK and then drop dead of a heart attack, rather than commit suicide to escape the intense pain caused by a prescribed drug."
My doctor told me the symptoms had to go away after taking few more Second time: I took other 3 pills in 3 days.
Great results.

Looking back I realize now that I had symptoms early on but chose to overlook them.
Lowers my count to 240 but is it woth it ?

No side effects.
Orthopedist seems to think its normal aging (I'm only 55) and internist is skeptical that lipitor is the culprit.
I will start taking it again as my cardiologist has encouraged me to stay on the medication.
"If I can find something, I will stay on Lipitor."

Doctors just conducted biopsy of leg muscle because it is inflamed and waiting for results.
"After taking Lipitor for several months, and gradually incrasing my dose to 40mg, I started to get EXTREMELY fatigued."
I'm scared to death.
this med works like a dream.
none that I can think of.
"I've been post-menopausal for five years and have now had a six day period with all the accompanying tender breasts, bloating, cramping etc"
Doctors need this information!.
"It can kill you: post operatively I suffered bleeding, peritonitis, septicaemia,renal and respiratory failure."
Is this life-threatening?.
they are the perfect med as they will cause the poor dumb patient to spend huge sums of money on tests-pain killers and other statins till they will one day they will just give up and lay down and die-BROKE-what a well laid plan by big pharma and covered by the criminal FDA food and drug syndicate.

And now it looks and feels like the medical establishment is keeping it all a dirty little secret for the sake of the income that statins generate.
"I have only been on Lipitor for 3 weeks so I don't know how it has worked on my cholesterol but the muscle cramps,spasms, and joint pain are soon going to force me from taking the drug."
"About a year later, I was put on it again and once again the same symptoms returned."
I have had a blood test to determine if Lipior is causing this serious problem and the results said no it wasn't.
THERE WAS NO RELIEF.
"Became unable to walk without a cane, unable to sleep, kidney problems (urine like root beer)."
I was hoping this one would do the job.
I quit taking the crap before my appointment with DOC.
"Other side effects included: weight gain, periorbital edema, fatigue, lack of libido, and detachment."

My hands and hip pain remain.
"abdominal cramping, gas."
"Have stopped taking lipitor, changed my diet, and life is slowly getting back to normal."
No side effects.
and I was taking 40 mg.
"dificulty in concentrating, short term memory problems, occasional dizziness also leg muscle soreness."
Can take it on an empty stomach with no problem.
I WOULD NOT TAKE THIS MEDICINE-WOULD RATHER DIE OF HEART ATTACK THAN FEEL LIKE THIS FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.
I didn't realize this was the cause until I researched a little to see what side effects had been encountered.
I started feeling an odd sensation in the center back of my calves.
"I just went for test and haven't gotten results yet, but Dr feels I have more than 1 form of arthritis, I also have a very sensitive stomach, this is cheaper and more approved by health insurance, so that is why this prescribed."
Nor sure why my doctor thought it would help my endo pain.
The pain has gradually subsided but it has not disappeared over a period of several months.
Was put on lipitor immediately before the surgery 1.5 years ago.
"Jaw,neck, low back and hip pains."
I was not as aware of dangers as I am now and would not have taken it if not advised by MD.
Please be carefull with lipitor and the other statins !!
"I have been suffering with severe swolen/inflamation of the fingers/hand & wrist pain for 8 months and attributed it to new blood pressure medicine or arthritis; however, after going off the new blood pressure meds for 5 weeks, I have noticed no remarkable change and have had blood work and x-rays indicating NO arthritis."
I know it's dangerous but so are the drugs.
Around 4 hours after I took the pill (on a full stomach) the pain and diarreha would start.
None whatsoever.
Dosage for past 2 yrs has been 40 mg once a day.
All side effects disappeared within 2 or 3 days.
For me I believe that this drug is a poison.

"Bleeding mini periods, lightheaded some time, finger tingling when I wake up."
"I can walk fine, I can even run."
This medicine seems to work very well.
Fatigue and laziness is gone and afternoon energy levels are high (as indicated by no yawning!).
"After 3 days of not taking it, most leg pain went away."
"Improvements noted two weeks after discontinuing, did not regain full range of movements in arms for two years."
This drug will hurt you more than help you.
"I have been taking simvostatin for about 5 years,,since March 2010 i have been experiencing pain in my left leg and foot with exteem pain in my ankle and at times i have had dificultly in walking to the point were on some days i could not walk at all because the pain was so bad also had pain in my left arm as if i had strained it lifting but i havn't been lifting, this is not like me because i am normaly very fit and i love walking."
Will see doctor if it continues to be a problem in 1 week though i see some have continued to have problems even after stopping and after reading this blog i am swayed to think that it is a degenative muscle problem( which will heal in time due to 1 pill only usage) and may not be other internal organ reactions as i 1st suspected.
Severe lower back pain and an aching pain across my shoulders.
Pain in muscles of both upper arms.
He is also on testosterone therapy.
It is the BEST pain reliever I have ever been prescribed and I will never do without it!
I am now walking up the stairs 95 % normal and can actually walk through a mall without having to sit down every 5 minutes.

Alot of gas and nausea.

Tried 10mg/day for 8 days one year ago with same side effects.
Constant feeling of fatigue.
"I felt that i was in another world, and i didn't even need her at all."
Stay tuned.
The medical profession should be made to advise patients more about the side-effects.
They do!
COULD NOT WALK AFTER 60 DAYS.
Pain returned.
Stopped taking it after 3-4 weeks.
Seeing the doctor next week.
I wish I had stopped taking this poison before it caused permanent nerve damage.
The 10mg brings my level to the cutoff point.

"I think it is a poison, some people do need statans I guess, but not me!."
It also seem to increase my heart rate therefore could not sleep well.
"Now focusing on TRIG/HDL ratio, TRIGlyceride levels, and keeping blood sugar in acceptable range."
I have taken it for a long time and only in the last year have these symptoms occurred - perhaps these are long-term usage effects.
When it got so bad I could not take it anymore and did not care about my cholesterol I took myself off of Lipitor and got a 50% improvement after one week.

SHE is 71 years old was a active lady.

"I am 6' tall, weighed 177 lbs., and considered myself healthy until recently."
"BOTH had heard similar stories about lipitor and they had each heard of all of these symptoms being connected with it (FWIW, I have a large number of hypersensitivities to several other drugs [as well as to alcohol], so this was not a big surprise to me.)."
"To be fair, I must note that I was also taking Norvasc - a blood pressure pill and when the above symptoms persisted I stopped Norvasc at once (replaced with Diovan)."

(Don't think I need a face lift yet) Facial swelling is listed as one of the side effects but my nurse practicioner doesn't say anything.
"because the insurance company required a trial at this high level, before I can switch to an alternative and reduce the dose back to 40 mg."
Thought it was menopause.
After 2 months I started having leg cramps and very dark urine.
"Read the drug company studies, they even say it may help prevent a heart attack when you have 3 of the aforementioned risk factors."
It is poison for me.
It is great to be able to sleep & function again.
I did this myself after consulting the doctor and taking him a print out of a web site with all symptoms listed.
I have been off lipitor for almost 2 weeks and still feel pretty lousy.

I have been told it will take at least 3 months for this medication to flush from my system.
Constipation.
diuretics taken to relieve edema caused cholesterol to go higher and M.D. recommended more Lipitor which made the edema worse and so on; got off that downward spiral 2 months ago and cholesterol went right back up to 300+ within a week but I'll take my chances and try to find some way other than statins so I can get some quality of life back.

NEVER NEVER TAKE THIS DRUG.
"Then two days later I came down with bronhitis, and asthma."
The last few days I have experienced swollen legs and ankles and a pain in my lower leg making it hard to get around.
Muscule pain and numb leg chest pain.
Subsequent uterine & vaginal ultrasounds did not show anything else to be the cause.
However I do believe that any Doctor prescribing Lipitor should make it abundantly clear to the patient that very serious consequences could ensue that would cause extreme pain and could effect quality of life.
Doctor took me off.
"When I sat down for a bit and then stood up, I couldn't move my legs."
Had no pains until 4+ years on lipitor.

The pain was so bad I could not get out of the bed and had to crawl to get to the bathroom to take Advil.
"Feels like menstrual cramps, back ache, sick to stomach for 24 hours +."
More problems and this time I had the idea to go on Internet and I discovered I had a lot of the side effects by taking it.
I was mostly feeling drained and tired which was unusual for me and didn't feel that way previous to taking the drug.
"Not all people who take Lipitor will have adverse reactions, but if you do experience these symptoms, don't just accept your doctor's denial of a connection between the two."

This was the first time I had the reaction.
has anyone been onthe same pills
I wouldn't recommend this to anyone!
My doctor dismissed the leg pain and said that kidney failure was unrelated.

"A doctor Peter H. Langsjoen says in July 8, 2002."
"20mg dose and will try for two months, if something happens sooner I'll stop before the two months are up."
I feared I might be over reacting to the muscle ache!
"after going off it,significant spectacular improvement for 4 days on all symptons,slight continuing improvement in last 6 weeks, estimate 50 percent improvement over next 2 years,md's no help,act like they work for drug company not patient,this sight will save more lives and life than all statins combined,love your dotor, its just economic survival for him."
I think it could be the result of taking Lipitor.
My brother is also on Lipitor and has had recent knee surgery for a torn miniscus and ACL.
I had muscle pain in my chest.

"aches and pains, muscular soreness in arms and shoulders."
It does!.

I WAS THEN PUT ON INSULIN.

I have to rate it a 5 for knee pain so I lived with it.

I feel great on Lipitor but could not take Zocor(side effects).
"I could hardly walk, sit or drive the car."
I am contacting my doctor immediately and as of now no more lipitor.
Perhaps the effects were slower because he was on 75 mg of CoQ10.
I might also mention that I started on 10mg and experienced really no side effects.
No muscle or joint problems through 1 year.
"It really lowered my cholestrol a lot, so I hope this problem isn;t related."

Very effective at lowering cholesterol but if you are prone to muscle inflammation or other connective tissue pain (due to rheumatoid arthritis or fibromyalgia for example) I would be very cautious.
It's changed my life and I think of the loss every single day.
Have been off Lipitor for 3 weeks and have not needed Nitro since.
I final went to the doctor and i am getting x-rays on my spine tomorrow.

"Severe (burning) pain in upper and lower left arm and left hand, stiffness and pain in both knees, pain in upper back (over left shoulder blade)."
"Just 2 years ago, I walked 4 miles a day, or rode my bike for 45 minutes a day."
Perhaps there is something not right yet with Arthrotec.
I look sickly.
Most doctors will say it is such a small amount that it will not matter.
It passed within 45 minutes and I was able to go to work the next day.
"I am trying the VitC, CoQ10 and omega 3 path."
"I developed constipation and flatulence, which I had rarely suffered from before taking Lipitor."

"Joint pain in shoulder, I could not lift my arms over my head."
I also cannot concentrate like I used to I get tired vry easily.
Sounds as though the phamacuticals companies need to sell more statins.

NONE.
Although the Lipitor brought my level from 206 down to 143 within 6 weeks from what I have been reading I don't think I will begin taking it again.
I was sure I was a few months away from a wheelchair.

I'd rather live off rice cakes and water.
Had no other health concerns.
I would not recommend it.
"Expensive out of pocket, though."
Then deep muscle pain in the muscle of one arm then the other.
Everyone I talk to who is taking Lipitor says they have leg pain.
I would much rather put up with my debilitating chronic knee pain (waiting for surgery) than to ever take another pill.

Triglycerides were 96-now 69.
i was prescribed arthrotec 75 to take twice a day with or before food.

That is the question.
"When my Cholesterol shot up to 300, I reconsidered and tried it again."
"slight flush, sedation, bed wetting."
"With Lipitor, it's impossible for me to even walk slowly, so what point is there in taking Lipitor?"

"When I not only paid someone's bill but also drove off WITHOUT HANGING UP THE PUMP, I stopped taking the drug."
I am also on Lopid to reduce Triglycerides.
Do not take statins!
Too bad all of this showed up after so many years.
"I went off the meds, and am now in search of a new MD, as I have felt worse under this DR care than ever before in my life."
and CANCER especially in the elderly.
"Now, severe cramping."
The bottom of my foot is extremely tender as are my calves.
This has gone on for 2 years now and is not getting straightened out.
I wouldn't suggest voltaren because it did nothing for the inflammation in the knee and has me in a panic until I can get this stuff out of my system.
as for me seems to be really good.
Absentminded.

None noticable.
Can you believe that!
Constant gas and constipation.
"I have no other side effects, but some fatique (I'm 57)."
This drug has been a god-send for me.
Maybe Lipitor?
I urge people to think twice about taking this drug.
The stress caused by losing my hair in this way will probably do me more harm than having high cholesterol.
Thank you!!!
I am going to quit taking it.
"Headaches, fatigue, confusion and memory loss."
So frustrating!
I took this drug for 1.5 years.
If you are over 50 it is better to have high cholesterol than too low!!

And has server pain all over her body.

"the first pill i took it caused severe abdominal pain but after taking the first one it never did that again , but recently i've been feeling like my stomach is full and empty at the same time hard to explain but thats what it felt like , and also have been getting bruises allover my body due to this drug , other than that my back is back to normal now and i am back at work."
So I am here looking for information about the side effects - anecdotally presented - as the web site for Lipitor does not have the information that would typically come on the drug sheet .
Second doctor said has been seeing lots of patients who have similar problem with statins and blood tests not confirming inflamation.
"There is a wonderful website Spacedoc.net with much information on the statins, and he has published a book as well on the serious side effects of the statins."
"After some time off of this drug and feeling better, I tried it again."
"I have been on this medication for approximately two years and it has been very affective in lowering my cholesterol; however, I did notice that I became depressed with intermittent muscle pain."
Anyway I asked the second doctor about Liptior side effects re. leg cramps and he felt that the side effect could be localized and that the cramps could.

I would never take or recommend this drug to anyone.
Stopped 4 days ago.
My physician said it was all in my head.
"I do Restorative Yoga postures to get myself loosened up every day, but keep the Cataflam handy as nothing works better for the pain, unless I have an extremely bad time where I have to take a Demerol with it (rarely)."
I mentioned it to my doctor who said it couldn't possibly be related to the Lipitor .
By dropping my total cholesterol from 259 down to 200 only reduced my risk factor by 1%.
Thank you everyone for taking the time to write so we aren't prisoners to just our doctor's advice!.
Doctor said it couldn't possibly b e that - I stopped in two days cough had gone.

My dr. said diastolic dysfunction can come from age.

I was skeptical when my doctor asked me to try Arthrotec but my pain is totally under control without any apparent side effects.

I think it has something to do with the spinal disks expanding at night and by morning something that was damaged in that area by Lipitor kicks in pain.
Overall decline in life.
"I have been on this for a month and so far I am tolerating this, but if the side effects get worse, I would have to decide if dying at 60 from a heart attack is worse than living in misery until 80."
Memory Loss.
We are all desperate to find an answer (the cause) and ultimately a cure.
Why did they take Baycol off the shelf and not Lipitor

Doctors should tell us about all the natural things to try first before turning to big drug companies!
It seems as if bleeding forever is a side effect but doctors tell you that its not the drug
tired-weak-pains all over body-groggy-light headed.
Will now stop taking Liptor having read the comments on this site and hope I recover.
"muscle weariness in legs, especially after waking up."

I also take a buffer with this.
Here are my experiences of taking Lipitor and Zocor statins over ~NEARLY 30 YEARS~!
Doctor agreed I could be having severe side effects of STATIN drug - has insisted I need my cholesterol attended to - has now put me on BEZALIP (no relation to STATINS so I am told) I haven't filled the script yet - need to do more research.
Rare Side Effect.
I told my doctor I took myself off the drug.
"muscels hurts, week."
I was never warned that any of the symptoms I have experienced were in any way related to Lipitor.
"Combined with a low fat/low cholesterol diet, the drug helped lower my cholesterol to 125 from well over 200."
"The Lipitor was great at lowering my cholesterol and improving the ratio of my HDL's to LDL's; however, on the advice of my doctor I have discontinued taking Lipitor for the time being."
I am 45 and a half years old and was on 20 mg of Lipitor due to genetically high LDL for a period of seven months.

"Hip, back and leg pain."
I want to educate people as to the REAL cause of heart disease.
Wokred great at lowering cholesterol from 276 to 194 but at what price?
"plus saw palmetto,fish oils ,south beach diet,hydration but stil a long way from all clear,mental strength improving first,but body is still racked,depression has left but still resting when i can and still feeling extremely vulnerable."
"nausea,extreme hunger,stomach pain, abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding,cramps."
there is one thing that i need to look into.
I am hoping that I did not hurt myself permanently by taking it.
I then saw a neurologist who diagnosed me with statin induced myalgia.
I am hoping this goes away soon and doesn't cause any long term damage.
2-3 month.
can we quit this med cold turkey?
"I bike 60+ miles a week, plus weight train twice a week."
Have a 5 month supply but getting off quick!.

Lipitor diet and excercise have lowered my cholestrol.
It was a disaster Ifyou have any problem do not hesitate.

Side effects increased noticeably a few months after starting tricor.
After reading more about the medication I can only say that for me.
"I had taken pravochol for years with not side effects, but wasn't lowering my cholesterol enough."
Then I started crying for no reason.
sometimes I get cramps in thigh.
Severe muscle cramping.
I ask my Dr about my hairloss and spots on my body&was told [Your age]whenI lost my ability to walk very far I ask my pharmacist what drug if any would cause this she said stop the Lipitor and get to your Dr a.s.a.p.

I have been taken for approximately 4 yrs.
"The only side effect they asked about was muscle pain, which I didn't have, and I was basically told Lipitor doesn't cause anything else."
It worked wonders for my pain - I thought that I had discovered a wonder drug - then after 30 days I was at work and started passing massive amounts of blood without pain or warning.
Doctor suspected Neuropathy when Athlete's foot couldn't be detected.
I think some of my symptoms are related to being post menopausal rather than from the Lipitor.
Was on IB 1600 a day and 2 tylenol 8's a day.
I've been on this.
Thank you!
occasionally some leg cramps (in lower left leg only) if taken too late in the day.
The drug is toxic and will probably kill you before the high cholesterol will.
Insomnia.
"In any event, I haven't had any serious problems with this drug aside from having to be a bit more careful in the gym and being the butt of fart jokes."
"In trying to reduce it, statins stop a whole cascade of addditional enzymes and proteins that are absolutely necessary for healthy bodies."
Then I decided to look on the internet to find out what was causing the pain.
I'm in the hospital waiting a liver transplant after taking this drug for only 2 months.
i wonder if there is a genetic component related to this--if some people with genetic variability suffered an interaction with statin (as the environmental agent) to produce this neurodegenerative disease.
HOWEVER THEY DID TRY TO PUT ME BACK ON THEM SEVERAL TIMES.
without pain killers for the constant trigeminal neuralgis (a side benefit to be sure).
I went to see my doctor and told him about my discovery.

"After several doctors, they are saying now that it was probably caused by the Lipitor."
No strength.
absolutly changed my life.

none that I'm aware of.
"Depression, bursitis in left hip didn't respond to 5-6 cortisone shots, PT, toes hurt when sheet touched, MEMORY LOSS-severe, dizzyness, in a FOG bottoms of feet hurt, felt like shin splints,tingling in 2 fingers of left hand."

THE DR DIDN'T LOOK FURTHER.

Up until 3 weeks ago I was taking LIPEX another member of the Statin family - reduced my cholesterol very satisfactorily.

"At first indigestion all the time, stomach pain, muscle aches - Dr was testing my count for liver problems - suddenly count was so high it put me in the hospital, yellow skin, eyes, urine dark brown."
Don't trust side effects especially memory difficulties and muscle-joint degeneration that some researchers say.
New doc gave me a different statin but I had leg cramps so he put me on Baycol.
"Other than the cramps I also have fatigue, muscle twitching, foot pain (10 x-rays), and numbness and tingling in the hands and arms."

Taking 80mg.
'Severe aggitation' and quick to snap.
My symptoms developed gradually enough that I assumed I was relapsing with rheumatoid arthritis -- I was astounded to find the problem was Lipitor.
Developed severe thigh muscle pain (both legs involved) and could not walk 75 feet.
"Severe B/L shoulder pain, general weakness, malaise, and slight memory loss."
Hearing that so many other people have experienced the same exact symptoms as me has given me the courage needed to STOP this medication.
"Diet, excercise, niacin all help but have stress test and know heart attack symptoms regardless."
I am so glad to have come across this Web page.
Am going to stop taking the drug and see if the symptoms improve.
i have type2 diabetes.
They all checked out okay.
Lipitor has robbed me and my family of my former active self and I have no idea whether I will ever return to normal.

This was a solution my doctor came up with.
I was on Lipitor for 3 years with no problems.
I put this off as a work-out related pain.

Now I am in servere pain everywhere and trouble sitting or standing or sleeping because staying still increases pain so I have to keep moving around.
Pain and weakness increased until I needed help dressing and combing my hair.
I am going to speak with my doctor about this possibility.
I thought I might have a bulging disc but decided to go off the Lipitor again.
"It is terrible, I stopped taking it and am going to kick my doctors butt."
Think positive!.
Symptoms progressive.
"I put the patch on at bedtime, tape the edges down and wear a sock to secure it."
"Since reading all of the comments, I know it is not in my head !"
"zombie like tired depressed state,severe pain in calves total loss of support unable to walk,vertigo like attack, blured vision, no sex drive,decrease in balance."
"Body aches, joint pain, decreased mobility, decreased testosterone and libido, difficulty getting out of bed in the morning, tingling and itchy hands,and decrease in overall strength."
"Constant aching/pain and weakness in arms, wrists, back of hands and shoulders."
"been off it 10 months,drs spent fortune 160 k looking for additional cause found none,i believe i know how to treat it and what other factors contributed to my severe reaction but it would take a book."
my cholesterol has been lowered substantially.
"My wife and I bo,th shared weakness in legs, pain in legs, hair losss, Rashes, itchy when I went to sit down instead of sitng normaly I would almost fall down in the chair no control no strength, upon getting up I had to hold on to something to get up."
depression was awful!!!!
Yes it did lower cholesterol and LDL but June 04 dosage increased from 20 mg to 40 mg per day because ldl had elevated again and Dr wanted ldl @ 70 and mine was at 114.
"Kidneys have cleared, but will still give me problems if I fatigue myself."
"BUT now after having been off of meds for 3 weeks, I am experiencing high blood pressure and ankle swelling like crazy!!!!!"
My PA stopped the Lipitor.
All results negative.
"On day two I noticed a rash on the outside part of my left arm, then the it spread to to my back and front of my neck by day three."
Effects reversed over 2 months after terminating the 10mg/day dose.
"After 3 doses of this med over 24 hour period, my pain was better; however, I experienced severe stomach cramping and diarrhea."
Lower back pain.
Thank God I found this site.
"I'm going to take Omega 3, carry on exercising and try my luck."
The stomach pain comes and goes and can become quite uncomfortable.
"had to stop taking it too many side affects, lowerd my cholesterol nicely but made me miserable with each passing month."
"Maybe the people not affected by Lipitor lead a non physical life or do not have any muscle, and therefor do not notice the effects.????."
Daily headaches.
"Previously I have taken ZOCOR and MEVACOR with similar results, but not has pronounced as with LIPITOR."
I was told that what I went through was a rare experience for people on Lipitor and other statins; but I had two reactions this past year to Lipitor first and then later to the Pravachol my Dr switched me over to.
seems to work on cholesterol but there should be a better way.
My internest never suggested it could be the lipitor.
My legs are still very weak even now - but they don't cramp.
Am definitely thinking of going off lipids since doing some research.
This side effect makes you feel like you are constantly wearing heavy socks and gloves.
There has been some increase in jo.
haven't noticed any difference/relief from this drug.
"During my third doctor visit, my doctor finally believed that I got bad side effects and he told me it would take months for recovery."
The pain I was experiencing especially around the hipjoints was incredible.
Returned to normal within a week of quitting Lipitor.
High cholesterol runs in my family and I am greatful that Lipitor can help me manage this.
Some of the side effects haven't totally disappeared but I'm improving with each day.
"was on 10mg for 6 months,increased to 40mg for 6 months,reduced back to 10mg (because high CPK level)for rest of time taking med."
"Its not perfect, but it keeps me alive."
My doctor said it was arthritis or bursitus due to my age.
"I had no other symptoms of heart problems, but I had high blood pressure and overweight."
"After the second pill the same progression of symptoms only now the abdominal gas,cramps and pain would be with me all day."
Good Medication - Overall cholesterol dropped from 284 to 174 in one month.
"Weakness in both legs, hip pain, knee pain, feet and ankle pain."
"headache, gas, bloating, mood swings, ill feeling, paranoid, anxious."
He got aggitated and asked what articles I had been reading and where I got my information.
but if that doesn't help.
I started taking Lipitor about three weeks ago and felt the before mentioned symptoms almost immediately.
"However, I started to have these symptoms to a lesser degree two weeks before I started the Lipitor due to a viral upper respiratory infection."
"After finishing my business, I hardly could sleep that night."
Went to the internet and found this site.
Not addictive.
Had months of aquatic therapy & it did not help.
"Symptoms worsened, swelling at knee, drained 25 cc fluid."
"Muscle cramping, fatigue and depression."
"I suspect the drug is responsible, but as I am only taking it short-term, I am not overly concerned."
And how to lower LDL without the side effects of statins?
When you are taking Statin and drink alcohol the side effects increase dramatically.
Brain fog.
It took a few months for the pain to subside.
I thought I was bleeding to death!
"I thought that I was just aging and/or out of shape, but it might be the lipitor."
Arm stiffness.
I think I've been ok with this medication.
It does help alot I noticed that when there are times when I forget to take it I can't stand or walk for any lengths of time.
However I did consider the side effects of Lipitor I read in other websites.
"Don't know if this will really help anybody -- but just please be cautious with Rx medicines and advocate for yourself; you may not know everthing, but you do know best about what you are experiencing with these Rxs."
"I had an extreme reaction - tunnel vision, vertigo, tingling and numbness (hands, legs, face), complete weakness in the right side of my body including loss of strength, and what I term as complete body flushes (like a hot flash without the hot)."
Was switched to Lipitor 40mg initially with fair results and then to 80mg with excellent results.
doctor said no way could it be possible it was a side effect.
So far this voltaren rapid 25 hasn't.
"The only residuals I am now dealing with are some minor muscle aches and twitching, which are slowly getting better."
After another mth they will do more bloodwork.
It also causes problems with balance - especially tring to walk heel to toe.
This is a terrible drug! DO NOT TAKE!
"Hard to function without (pain),when I ran out."
X-rays did not show a fracture & MRI did not show a tear.
I cannot believe the immediate difference this medication had made in my life.
It is misoprostol 200MG.
"Well, guess what happened."
Now I trust that what I was felling 6 years ago was not all in my head.
if pain returns I will have to seek other alternatives besides Lipitor.
"tiredness, foggy brain, sore feet/legs, left shoulder upper arm pain, occasional neck pain, nose extremely dry/swollen nasal passages, skin - white patches, windy towards evening/night."
"I am a medical transcriptionist and do a lot of typing, but my hands are so painful, I can hardly sleep at night."
But have been complaining to my Dr for a while now of terrible muscle pain and nothing was mentioned that it could be Lipitor.
"Not sure if related, but increase in burning sensations in legs and hands started around the time this drug was added to my list."
I have had all kinds of test and they all come up negative.
Now on 40mg but am eating more healthy and will have blood checked soon.
I read & ried-I was NOT crazy!
"Very very severe abdonimal pain, next day my stool was black which could indicate blood in my stool, going to doctor today."
My mother developed dementia while taking this terrible drug.
Within 2 days of stopping Lipitor I feel unbelievably better!!!!
Dr's are not Gods and they don't know everything - some don't know much at all - talk to the experts - cardiologists and heart consultants!!!
"According to my 'GP' (Dr), th."
be very aware of any physical/emotional changes.
"Definitely helped lower my cholesterol from 263 to 164 -- amazing, but I'm afraid to continue taking due to experiencing same severe side effects."
My doctor (conservative and top-rate) says that taking Lipitor is a no brainer .
I have had three blood tests over time which indicate that the lipitor is not damaging the muscles.
This drug should be taken off the market.
i would recommend plenty of food and water with this medicene.
I will look for a new doctor and hope I am doing the right thing.
"Mood problems, language problems, and memory problems lessened by still present."
"Extreme fatigue, muscle aches, cramps, MEMORY problems, balance problems, cold toes and feet (with NO circulatory problems) cold hands, dry throat/hoarseness, slurred speech."
"I told him no more statins and he then prescribed Zetia, which he said was was less effective but was not a statin, which I am still afraid to take unless I improve from the affects of the Lipitor."
Came off it to see what happens.
"To be fair, I am on 3 other medications, so if I was to have any side effects I wouldn't know what to attribute it to anyway."
"NOW, I check the markings on my pills."
I had my cycle The last one for 4 days.
Slight leg strength improvement noticed.
"took Lipitor for over a year with no negative effects, then gradually developed terrible joint pain, couldn't move shoulders, hips hurt, had to push out of chair like old person."
little improvement with the pain.
He said he sees a lot of patients with slightly elevated CPK that many physicians do not recognized as a symptom of a statin intolerance.
"I researched Lipitor in a pharmacy book and realized hair loss, along with most of my other ailments, were side effects."
"It work great on reducing cholesteral level, but its side effects became another problem for me."
"After I used it the first time, the puffiness and pain were gone!"
I cant believe how many people have felt the same way and thought the same things I did!
"I take 80mg./day at night along with asprin, 100mg of Atenolol and a host of others."
I don't know where I'd be if I had continued taking lipitor beyond the 3 days!!!.
"pain in upper right arm, could not sleep on it or move it behind my back."
I thought I had gout or arthritis.
"I need to be able to pass a physical readiness test, including a 1.5 mile run, every 6 months because I'm in the military."
The experience was a certain kind of hell!.
So I bought a new pair from the chemist they didn't stop the pain either.
I spent $100 on the stupid pills - what an utter & complete waste of money.
The pain in my stomach is in the middle of my stomach above my belly button and its a deep constant pain.
Otherwise healthy and active 43 year old.
I FELT LIKE I HAD BEEN RUN OVER BY A TRUCK ALL THE TIME.
GREAT STUFF.
"Muscle twitching, stiff neck, constant lightheadedness, always worrying about a brain tumor or something."
WHAT A PRICE TO PAY!!
Just before this last Christmas I had a small stroke and spent three days in the hospital.
"If I tuck something under my arm, I get a charley horse in my side."
"Very little side effects, cheaper, and does the same job as Lipitor."
"Besides the toll that statins have taken on my quality of life, I've also spent tens of thousands of dollars on doctors, drugs, tests, labs, & procedures."
A question to us about Letter #48: What is the evidence of benefit for primary prevention in women?
leg cramps.
I was also starting to become depressed.
I have heard from two other people who have ended up with Polymyositis from Lipitor.
I cut a patch (there are five in each reclosable pouch) in half and it covers the heel area.
"I decided to be off Lipitor on my own and within a couple of weeks, the pain and stiffness from the neck and pain in the shoulder and back is going away, I feel much better now that I am not taking Lipitor."
"This drug did amazing things with my chloresterol levels, it reduced it from ( Australian standards ) 7.5 to 1.9 ( generally considered OK level is 5.4 )."
"SHOLDERS, HANDS, I CHALKED IT UP TO BEING 58 AND MAYBE ARTHRITIS BUT AFTER READING ALL OF THE VIEWS FROM OTHERS ON LIPITOR I AM CONSIDERING STOPPING IT TO SEE IF I GET MY OLD SELF BACK AGAIN."
Sure discovered it soon: Lipitor.
Don't feel better or worse on it but the angiogram was scary so I'll keep taking it until some real Drano comes along.
I stopped taking Lipitor and Tricor about 6 weeks ago.
"Spent most of the day in bed, reading a book, something I rarely do."
Flu-like symptoms and fatigue.
painfull stiff joints pins and needles on right arm.
I had the joint and muscle pain already and was told it was arthritis or neuropathy (I'm also a diabetic).
I won't make same mistake.
"Felt like it was burning my esophagus all the way down, then dry heaves once it hit my stomach."
"WHEREAS TOTAL CHOLESTEROL HAD BEEN OVER 200 PREVIOUSLY, NOW IT WAS ONLY 151 AND THE BAD PORTION."
It has truly been amazing how this drug has helped me.
"terrible nightmares and insomnia, leg cramps, fatigue."
"So Lipitor is great for reducing your numbers, but extending your life ???."
Cannot take any statins ever again.
I stopped taking it and they went away.
Someone at the Dr's office recently recommended to me to do a search for possible connection between statin use and tendon damage/ruptures.
I went from being energetic & very active to being unable to even do my own grocery shopping.
Have days where confusion comes back also.
"Unfortunately, it didn't work at all on my migraines, so I'll continue to look for something else as a backup."
"I really really hope it is reversible, because I can't walk or do anything with my hands."
"After one week, realized that I could not handle this!"
Have stopped taking Lipitor and symptoms seem to be subsiding.
"Shoulder, knee, elbow, joint pain."
"Numbness in feet, leg, hip, neck cramps, eyes running, itchy and watery all the time like I was crying."
It has got to the point where turning over in bed wakes me up because of the pain it causes.
"WEAK MUSCLES ,POOR BALANCE,VERY VERY TIRED CAN'T WORK MORE THAN 2 HOURS WITHOUT A NAP."
to name but a few.
Certainly nothing I can't live with unless it worsens and after 10 yrs I doubt that will happen.
I dropped my Lipitor of 20mg down to every other day instead of just laying off of it and this has been pretty much the case so far.
I feel like I'm in a fog and it's a chore to just walk around.
"Was on Niacin (500mg) for 90 days, but showed no improvement."
I had a quadruple by-pass in 1987.
BEWARE.
"That was about a year ago and I am still having severe pain and weakness in my muscles, especially the legs."
The final week it turned into extreme vomiting and diarrhea.
Lipitor lowered my cholesterol from 268 to 163 but it nearly killed me in return.
I went to three psychiatrist and they finally came up with a diagnoses of bipolar disorder.
Legs were also very painful to the touch.
she had been taken it for two years.
I keep telling the NP that I don't like it but she says its working so I have to stay with it.
I haven't tried longer but I'm sure I could and getting to that level was a great accomplishment.
Neurologist finds no nerve involvement so think it must be drug-related.
"Hopefully my other symptoms of fatigue, anxiety, memory and insomnia will alleviate as well."
Loss of breath.

"I was diagnosed with high cholesterol when I was 19, I'm now 38 and started on Lipitor when I was 31."
"DEPRESSION, INSOMNIA, anxiety, tiredness, decreased eye sight, loss of quality of life."
Not any more!
"Extended periods of low mood, loss of self-confidence, loss of interest in life etc also brain fog & impaired memory."
I stepped out to get some air but it didn't work.
I think I will try once a day.
My doctor suggested going off lipitor as of today to see if that is the culprit.
I am 51 years and have had acne breakouts on my face and neck.
Total loss of libido.
I now wonder if the pain will ever go.
Now I can sleep at night and do most activities.
I Have been on lipitor for several years.
He diagnosed it as frozen shoulder.
Take raw oat meal sprinkled on your meal.
By the way 10Mg of Lipitor lowered my cholesterol 100 points but it was not worth it.
It worked quite well.
one week.
Elevated blood pressure and heart palpitations.
THE HEADACHES ARE GONE.
Symptoms began 12 weeks after starting Lipitor.
"It showed permanent, irreversible muscle damage."
Just tonight did I do a web search on lipitor and calf pain and now am pretty convinced it is the Lipitor from all I have read on this site.
This drug should have a pre-qualifier before perscribed or better yet.
muscles on the sides of my back were constantly painful; I could not sleep even with ambien and melatonin.
Lipitor worked great lowering cholesterol but the side effects are not worth the benefit.
"I started taking 10 mg per day along with omega 3, fish oil, change in diet and exercise and reduced total, LDL and Tri's to acceptable levels within 3 mos."
"Some leg pains at first, reduced with time."
I think drugs are released on the market these days without enough long-term clinical studies to make sure they are safe.
"Red Yeast Rice, for example, actually contains a statin (lovastatin) , so it will most likely have all the set of side effects as the other statins."
"The problems continued, and a specialist did a muscle biopsy."
Then my doctor had a bright idea to try Liptor again and the same symtoms came back.
Took 10mg lipitor for 7 years had soreness of muscles for 4 years.
I am hoping this all passes.
Lowered CHol from 251 to 171 with only 10mg.
Just terrible.
My cholesterol is still high but not as high.
"Two days after stopping, myself and my family noticed the difference - now 3 weeks have passed and have not had any of the above symptons."
On Lipitor for only three and a half weeks.
"Legs felt cramped and sore and weak, especially in calves and lower rear thigh muscles."
the hdl is high because of the Chlorella (3grams daily).
"I have had hip replacement, back surgery, and shoulder surgery while on this drug."
Lipitor hurts more than it helps.
Doc prescribed 800 mg Motrin qid but the foot problems became worse.
"But then, very gradually, things began to change."
"This is the number one prescribed medicine in the US right now, don't expect it to go away unless we stand against Pfizer and the FDA."
Thought it might be the Lipitor so I am going to the doctor in a few days.
"knees, shoulders, lower back, etc"
I have now decided to try other methods to reduce my cholesterol.
"I would recommend anyone who has experienced any side effects increased by alcohol, to consider an allergic reaction to the drug."
Bottoms of feet hurt and are so tight it's hard to walk.
GREAT results.
I kept asking my doctor if there were any side effects like mine and he said no.
10 mg lowered my cholesterol in the first 6 months.
So why didn't you mention that possibility before all the tests?
The loose stools and gas are more than I can bear.
I am waiting on him to call back.
This was one of the worst drugs I have ever taken.
"Pectoral chest pain- stabbing sharp pains, increasing in frequency as time passed."
"After taking it for 8 months developed widespread muscle pain - neck, back, hips, legs, and hands."
Went to hospital for my Tmj pain because it was getting out of control.
I would not recommend this drug to anyone.
My boyfriend is 49 and has had high cholesterol for about 10 years.
I'll never take anything with statin in it agin.
"I detest lawyers, but statin class drugs are crying out for a class action lawsuit to stop their use."
vaginal bleeding and cramping 2 years after menopause.
"I do have some weight around the middle which I wasn't noticing so much before, but this may be due to fact I'm now in my early 40's."
"sever muscle weakness with nerve damage,memory loss,red spots all over my body,hair loss,slowed speach,aphasia brain not sending messages to my muscles,shufflihg gait,unable to get out of chairs without help."
"Bouts of extreme forgetfulness, extreme muscle pain, insomnia, tremors, cluster headaches,kidney pain, urinary problems."
"I took the drug only once, at about 9:00 p.m."
I am considering stopping lipitor for a while.
I will never take it again.
"I also, lost my sense of taste during this whole thing."
Cardiologist offered no suggestions.
And I have to painfully put it back in.
Inform your GP as soon as you experience anything strange.
When I asked if I would feel better-he just said he hoped so-what is that supposed to mean??
90% effective- Hard on my stomach even when I take it with food.
None for the first 5 years.
Wondering if the benefits are worth putting up with all of this.
More problems and this time I had the idea to go on Internet and I discovered I had a lot of the side effects by taking Arthrotec.
The worst gas I've ever experienced!
"stomach pain, palpitations and feeling desperately miserable."

I started taking 10 mg a day around 9 months ago.
I wonder how many people will become seriously ill before they pull if off the market.
"In January, I started to go to the gym, and I think that this is where my problems really started."
"Again, this has not yet proven, nor have i gone down that road yet."

I added a rating about a month ago.
"My urine is bloody, I have got canker sores the size of golf balls, my face is falling off."
I was puzzled!!
I am going to try something natural instead.
"Never take this Drug or any other Statin Drug, as it has never been proven that Cholesterol will Kill you, especially when I know people who are not over weight and eat right only to have there Hi # above 400 and it is Genetic, with no one dying from Heart attacks in there Family's."
It DID lower my cholesterol.
unexplained cough.
"Some for high blood pressure, and thyroid medication."
Two days after starting the lipitor I felt like my insides were vibrating.
I am satisfied as the drug has been hugely successful on my Cholesterol levels.
I stopped it 8 weeks ago and still have much muscle pain and fatigue.
"Many Docs want to start you at 20mg or above, too much for the body to take, I think."
I'm convinced this drug will kill me before any possible heart disease!.

IF YOU ARE TAKING THIS MEDICATION CLOSELY WATCH FOR JOINT OR MUSCLE PAIN AND IMMEDIATELY SEE YOUR PRESCRIBING PHYSICIAN FOR A DIAGNOSIS IF YOU WANT RELIEF.
Do the benefits outweigh the severe side effects-Pfizer says it's rare but serious side effects-I know many people that have had the same problem with muscle damage so I would not consider the side effect to be rare and now since I'm off the drug wonder how much permanent damage to my muscles is their due to this awful drug.
