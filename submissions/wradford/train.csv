,What a nightmare drug for me!
,I was on it for 3 1/2 yrs.
,Explained to the doctor it wasn't helping to begin with 1 month after taking it so upped the dose on me and its done nothing to really help pick me up at all.

,I only took this for 2 weeks after years of taking aciphex with no ill effetcs(I had to start Nexium because I am active duty military and they switched from aciphex to nexium)my side effects have actually gotten worse in some cases.
,I can't believe they are putting people on this after a surgery...mastectomy...!!!
,"I was super dizzy for weeks, didn't feel right, always felt like I was going to pass out, fuzzy headed, I didn't feel right for a long time."
,I will be seeing my doctor this week and I am unsure how to approach her because of ny anger.
,A different dr. told me I had tinnitis 4 yrs ago & live with it.
,The headaches (or I should say 5 month migraine) was the worst part.
,If you start it is next to impossible to get off them.
,First it took me extra time to Orgasm.
,I would appreciate an answer.

,"Once I hit 0 I was finally able to orgasm again, and shortly it was as if there had never been a problem."
,For two years I have gone to the gym and taken calcium and for what?
,"Sexual side effects are there, however, you can work around it..."
,Went to bed at 10.
,"Those of you that have only been taking the drug less that a week or two should give it a chance, it usually takes drugs a couple weeks to level out in your system."
,I've never had skin problems in my life.
,I was on Effexor prior to this for about 2 years and I liked that anti-depressant but my doctor wanted to see if Cymbalta would help me with the neuropathy pain.
,I told the dr. how I felt and I was put on 60 mg!
,Every so often I get a bout of consti
,I will NOT risk taking this drug again...ever!
,"I feel I am ready to wean off this drug anyways as I am dealing well with my disease alot better, but am afraid of the side effects of withdrawls."
,Be careful when coming off this medication.
,I have only been taking Cymbalta for 12 days and will have to see how it goes in the next month.
,"i worked with my doc to ween off, yet i still have not been able to function as a mother or wife."
,"I still have residual pain in my trunk and hip muscles, but the severe foot pain is 100% gone."
,I will be increasing my dose to 60 mg in the next few days.
,"Doctor said, Yes, that is from cymbalta."
,At first I thought this drug was wonderful.
,"I was strongly encouraged to try to ride out the side effects, as a nurse, I know that these improve or disappate in time."
,"Sadly, this medicine worked REALLY WELL!"
,almost $80 a month for this rx!)
,"Before I started talking this medication I read a lot of the reviews here and was really afraid to take it.I decided to try it anyways because of the positive reviews here and I'm so glad I did.Since taking this medicine I have more energy,better able to concentrate and it controls my appetite.I have lost 15lbs already and have started to exercise."
,This drug should be taken off the market
,I am enjoying my life.
,for the first
,"Recently, it started pooping out (depression/anxiety has come back) and I'm bummed."
,I took strong pain killers all day once and it didn't relieve the discomfort.
,I recently learned that consuming more than a a few cocktails while on it can cause some pain.
,"It is not OK to just simply ignore anything that needs your attention, it is not ok to just to curl up and sleep through the weekend!"
,"I still have to take pain medicine, seems like I am taking less pain medication?"

,"I was prescribed Nexium 40mg for having burning problems in stomach, and acid."

,"When drugs are forgotten or skipped, burning symptoms re-appear."
,I sleep for the first time in 30 years and wake up feeling great.
,My mood has improved.
,"When I completely stopped, I was very depressed and anxious, was having ""brain zaps"", and was just not there mentally."
,"Today, Wednesday, a completely different story."
,Some drugs -- like this one -- are too new to be able to project that but SSRIs have been around long enough to get a sense of what has happened to people in the wake of taking them.
,"For heartburn, try tums or mallox or eat more Alkaline foods ( stop acidic foods such as tomatoes and coffee)."
,It has made it so I can have a normal life and prior to this drug I was only able to eat rice and drink ginger ale.
,"I am not sure about the gastritis, will find out after my next gastroscopy."
,"My life became normal after years of hearburn, reflux, gastritis, etc."
,"Cymbalta did what I needed it to, for the most part-it gave me concentration, the ability to stay awake, and improved my mood greatly."
,Finally fell asleep and slept the whole day and the next night.
,"If you can deal with the initial side effects, which seem to subside, this drug is worth it."
,Weaning off this med is brutal.
,My dr said that he had other patients who had experienced the same response.
,"I used to take Lexapro (10mg), and I grew an tolerance to it."
,This stuff is really addictive.
,Nice to hear others out there have similar side effects and positives .
,I was on lexapro on and off for several years with paxil (20mg) before that (20mg of lexapro at the highest and 5mg right now before I switched to Cymbalta).
,Once I started nexium the pain lessened.
,*USE WITH CAUTION*
,I'm back to teaching elementary school and I feel great.
,My doctors talked about this drug for a year trying to get me on it.

,Improved my mood but had no effect on my pain.
,Nexium leaves you feeling lousy and unwell.
,I'm hoping it doesn't take long to get back to normal I also had numbness in my right upper thigh which came on shortly after taking it but I never put two and two  together .
,"I was sleeping for a week during pms, since cymbalta I have a life even though I am disgusted with my body and I exercise reguarly"
,"Maybe right for some, cause everyone is different, but I want off this ride."
,Stuff doesn't bother me like it did.
,"Side effects stayed and now that I'm trying to slowly withdraw from it they have gotten worse and new ones have started, especially dizziness and irritibility and lack of energy."
,Gradually over 3 hrs the heavy dark shroud of miserable depression began to fall away.
,"It works so well for me, and I don't want to get off it."
,They don't like me when I don't have my Cymbalta.
,"With Cymbalta, I can taper down for two weeks and the only side-effect I have is mild dizziness and ""zaps"", which all of these medications cause when discontinuing them."
,Literally every part of my body hurt.
,It worked better than anything else I've tried.
,PLEASE GO TO THE FDA WEBSITE AND REPORT ALL YOUR ADVERSE SYMPTOMS!
,"In the beginnigng, I think it worked GREAT!"
,"Toward what became the last few days of taking the drug, I flipped into a kind of paranoia, believing everyone at work was talking about me."
,"Many of the severe side affects such as vomitting, nausea, restlessness,etc that people are describing happened to me the very first time I started taking an anti depressant, which was at the time Lexapro."
,The difference is dramatic.
,"Withdrawal wasn't too bad, I cut down slowly."
,"For SOME people it might be a godsend and I wouldn't turn your back on it based on ANY of these reviews (even mine) because if you need something to help you suffer less, then it's worth a try, just be prepared for the tough road to coming off of it."
,do not take this medication it should not be on the market.
,Horrific withdrawls for the short time I took it.

,I elevated the head part of the bed.
,I have had all the usual anti-depressants in the past but got myself off them all for the last 4 years and was taking a natural herb Holy Basil and that's it i am going back to that and my would rather stick to my lorazepam just 1mg a day takes all the fear and anxiety away.

,Did not help much with the depression.
,Dont want to go back to 60 in the am and then feel miserable later in the day.
,"Took 1 week off meds for tongue swelling and lip problem to go away, took 2 weeks off meds for thirst, insomnia, burning mouth to go away and 5 weeks off Nexium I think I am almost normal again....hence almost, not quite 100% as the breathing issue and anxiety pops up occasionally for a minute or 2 throughout the day."
,Prozac is the best thing to use to wean off with.
,"The next two doses produced dizzy spells that culminated with him fainting, although neither as dramatic as the one that sent him to hospital."
,"Now, after 1 year off I am giving Cymbalta another try."
,"Would go to sleep at 7pm, not wake up til the next day even with husband trying to wake me."
,Very costly.

,The FDA needs to hear about it.
,I finally was able to get my primary care doctor to prescribe Cymbalta.
,"Then one day I woke up with no energy and just felt tired, really tired."
,The side effects were mild to start.
,"I already take Slippery Elm Bark powder, mixed with water, 10 mins before eating."

,I'm now at 120 MG A DAY OF THIS S%*T...
,Before I would have had a STROKE!
,"I have been on Prozac in the past, Lexapro---which worked great for a year then nothing, and coming off of it was horrible."
,Since over a week I've experienced terrible dizziness; I even fell flat on my face a few times.
,I was up 120mg daily the last 2 months.

,I am sad/scared to see so many negative reports!
,"After about two and a half weeks on Cymbalta, the side effects began getting worse."
,and go to bed.

,"Depression lifted, suicidal thoughts went away and I could start climbing out of the darkness."
,"Not as it usually was, but I was able to stop the high blood pressure meds."
,Starting feeling differences about 2 weeks into the full dosage.
,Other days I would be extremely quiet and just want to be alone.

,Feeling terrible and desperate I turned to the web late one night.
,"IBS, vomiting, sweating, light sensitivity, flu symptoms."
,"but it did have good things like i became numb to alot of stuff that would have made me mad before,i have went from 60 to 30 without the dr approval for myself to try to loose some weight and dependency on drug, withdrawl symptoms better this time dont feel like a crack head coming off crack.. think its because i used prayer to help this time,if this is a last resort do it but if there are other options try them first.."
,"Instead my doctor has added Prozac, 10mg."
,"I would say if I continued with Cymbalta, I would've lost a drastic amount of weight because I had little/no appetite."
,I'm scared to death every day I'm on this but feel I have no options and Drs have no orientation to exploring other things with you.
,"Also, other studies now point at PPIs causing hip and spine fractures."
,At First Then Stopped And  Began A
,"It's Jan 29th now and I'm married, holding a steady job, i moved across the country, quit smoking, no drugs, rarely suicidal and most importantly very happy with my life and choice to stay on cymbalta."
,I never would have begun taking it.
,"I have stopped the drugs for almost 2 weeks now and my pains are all but gone, haven't felt this good in years!"
,"I have been taking Nexium 40mg for 3 weeks and for the first 2 weeks I felt some side affects such as lack of energy, tiredness depression, anxiety, and now I have had the flu for 5 days."
,I feel better on Cymbalta.
,"GREATFUL FOR CYMBALTA, BUT downsides INCREASINGLY TROUBLESOME."
,I am going back on Zoloft..stat!!!!
,Then I started reading up on the internet after my wife had seen a show on PPIs.
,I was so tired from the Cymbalta I could not even function.
,I am not a zombie I can think clearly I am not ruled by my anxiety.
,I have been on Cymbalta for two day's and have had no side effects.
,I suffer from Anxiety Disorder/Panic Attacks as well as some slight depression when my anxiety is not under control and I was prescribed this medication from an ER doctor.
,"I don't know what was worse, the sweats or nightmares."
,"Initially I felt as if I was ""awakened."""
,"I was always hesitant to commit to anything, not knowing how I was going to feel or how the activity would affect me."
,"because I thought I was having a stroke becaue I had the tingling and numbness of my head, face, and left arm."
,"Had to take this medicine at about dinnertime, then took Clonazepam to sleep."
,No more muscle spasms or tingliness in my limbs.
,Any comments for me?
,My husband thinks I need to stop taking it because I am not myself at all.

,"Had burning sensation in chest, acidy throat/burning when swallowing, bloating and gas."
,What's different in my life now that wasn't here before?
,"When I terminated use, it was good luck you are on your own."
,the second side effect is the sexual one.
,"I'm 15, and have been tried on every anti-psychotic and anti-depressant on the market."
,This drug was terrible.
,I am afraid I will have to be hospitalized.
,I thought of nexium.
,"I had nausea, and all of the above symptoms when first starting, but most of them already went away."
,My dad was prescribe Nexium for unremitting abdominal pain of a 6 month duration.
,I slept through the last 3 months.
,It took a week and a half for me to heal from the damage caused by a dozen doses of Nexium.
,Then I began waking up in the night and my left arm would be tingling and I wasn't even sleeping on it!
,Sex has been nonexistent...no desire.
,I called my doctor and stopped taking the Nexium.
,I'll check in later after another 6 months or so of using this powerful drug.
,"I do still have mood swings, though not as often."
,"The first two days I felt a bit more anxious, my brain was racing like crazy...but my mood was vastly improved."
,I had to stop taking it abruptly when I couldn't afford it and HELL SET IN!!!
,This seems to me like a pointless drug that is currently being heavily prescribed because it was recently approved.
,"I tried to stop taking Cymbalta, but reverted to having worse pain and very depressed."
,"Well, I did not know the WITHDRAWL would turn in to my falling asleep at the well and then totaling my car(lucky I was the only that got hurt.)"
,Cymbalta may work well for some people.
,"I developed stomach ulcers, I woke up in the middle of the night with a tight pain in the middle of my stomach which radiated out to my back so I couldn't sleep."
,Nexium started working immediately but stopped working after 50 days.
,But Cymbalta takes the cake for being the worst.
,"Once I start the 60mg, I will update my comments."
,"it usually brings out the best side of me EXCEPT when i miss a dose or two, its like a bad hangover times ten... i enter depression and cant get out of bed."
,I POSTED T
,"Time will tell for certain, but symptoms here so overlap with mine."
,I was amazed at how quickly it began to lift my mood.
,"Since then I've learned that the Reglan could have been the culprit and I have tried Xanax, Lexapro, Buspar, Trazodone, Prozak, Metoprolol, Ambien, and now Cymbalta."
,So Gastro.
,I stopped taking both.
,"I’m 70, could pass for 55, my grandfather died at 102 with a full head of hair, good genes I thought."
,i had gained 80 pounds over the 4 years i was on cymbalta and i went to a doctors weight loss clinic.
,He talks at length about nonsensical things.
,I was increased to 90mg and still had hypotension in the morning but the yawning went away.
,BUT...
,I'll start to miss 2 doses a week and see what happens.
,I was taking half of a regular dosage and took it for about two years.
,Hoping that will go away soon and hopefully I can loose this weight I gained!
,"I have been tested for everything, all which were negetive."
,I take the meds 30mg in the am and pm because I am unable to take large doses at once.
,"I never felt like this medication helped my symptoms, but I never took anything I thougth helped."
,Even today my heart is still racing.
,"Since that first year, I have had gallbladder removed, I have had at least 3 visits to emergency room with pain to my left side under my breast, I thought I was having a heart attack."
,My pain is gone!
,The drug woked well to supress my uc.
,"I am hoping the Cymbalta will work and the idea of losing weight, is an answer to my prayers."
,Took a very low dose once a day.
,I was falling deep into depression and was suicidal after a separation and immediately noticed a change within the first few hours after taking my first dose.
,I believe CYMBALTA HAS STOLEN THE HUSBAND AND FATHER WE HAVE ALL GROWN TO LOVE.
,This has worked well for chronic pain.Unfortunately I can't seem to take more than 60mg because I break out in serious hives on my face in the cheek and eye area.
,"I don't know if it is truly related to Nexium since I take so many other meds, but I've been on it the longest and couldn't imagine life without it."
,I strongly encourage anyone trying this medication to not go off it without talking with your doctor about how to do so safely.
,My reflux returned with such a vengeance--worse than before--that I could hardly swallow.
,Taking this drug is seriously putting your entire health at risk.
,"This medication definitely stabilizes me, but I'm concerned by how quickly my mood goes out of control with brain zaps when I go even 36 hours without a dose."
,I then started using Siberian Pine Nut Oil together with Nexium and after 2 weeks all my gastritis symptoms were gone.
,Im 21 and i have tried all the depression meds out there.
,"I started at 30, eventually up to 60 and was good there, when Dr prescribed 90 I asked to go back down."
,"Since the operation to remove my gb, I have severe anxiety and depression which could have been solved had I not been going around placing blame."
,This medication helped my depression somewhat but the constant upset stomach has been too much for me.
,No more in my back and just slightly in stomach area.I have resumed taking Acidolphus Pro-biotics which are helping.
,"I'm still on Wellbutrin XL, which stopped working for me over a year ago, but will probably stay on it while I'm &quo"
,Brain zaps and weight gain...WTF!!!???
,"I am bi-polar, and have also taken Lamictal 100 mg once per day on and off in the past."
,But I couldn't seem to get going until about 3PM.
,"Once I got through the first few weeks, I was happy and doing quite well, I was doing things and felt freer and just being me."
,I have been so depressed for the past 2 years and have not been myslef at sll.
,"I was on 60mg/d for a full year and then to 90 for a couple months which did nothing, so I had to wean off of it completely."
,"A few weeks ago, I had to start taking Nexium again..rapid beat..lasted for 2hours....didnt realize it could be the nexium."
,And my depression is about the same as it was in the very beginning.
,"So, we're ramping down verrrry slowly on the Cymbalta, and so far the only thing I've experienced is a couple nights of ""night sweats"" and a few ""brain flashes"" (but they weren't HORRIBLE as some people say.)"
,I still have the same *feelings* just without the physical effects.
,"i quit smoking a year ago and surprisingly the gerd got worse so i took more nexium, and in the last year my symptoms have gotten worse and iv'e started to gain weight (not because i ate to compensate, i didnt eat any more or less than i always have)."
,"When things bother me now, I'm more able to bounce back to a positive outlook."
,"Also, it is SCARY  to realize that children are being given this drug."
,"My personality completly changed, i wouldn't socialize with my friends, I just sat there."
,Incredible difference in my Depression and Anxiety levels.
,"Compared with coming off Clomipramine, this withdrawal is a walk in the park."
False,Taking 30 mg's and at first it was helping with the anxiety but then stopped.
,Either take the meds or try a bland diet.
,"I got in touch with the company and they gave me an information sheet which listed mylagia, depression, fatigue, confusion as rare (-5% of the population) side-effects."
,I have tried most of the usual antidepressants on the market with no improvement to my depression.
,Cymbalta did not work for me.
,"It was so persistent, I thought it was heart related and went to the emergency room in the middle of the night."
,became pregnant surprisingly (by natural means).
,I am convinced they are related.
,Absolutely no side effects at all.
,I have no idea how I could naturally get one!
,"after i started cymbalta, the pain stopped."
,I have not experienced any negative side affects.....all the side effects I have/am experiencing are tolerable.
,My doctor put me on Cymbalta 3 years ago to help with the chronic daily tension-type headaches I've been dealing with for 7 years.
,I had come off of 100mg.
,I hope this drug can help you too.
,"I plan to continue taking it, as I'm really happy with it so far."
,Very scary.
,"Start at a very low dose (e.g., 20mg or 30mg of Cymbalta) for several months; access the effects; then increase the dose a little at a time."
,I don't feel depressed anymore (except for my hair loss)
,I started having panicky attacks at the age of 18 and tried all the ssri's and was put on ativan as needed.
,"I never thought that I would be the one to have a bad reaction to this drug I just thought the people were crazy that did, and trust me their not !"
,my wife  committed suicide by self inflicted gunshot on dec. 12 06 as a result of an adverse reaction between cymbalta and lunesta.
,Cymbalta is almost a miracle for me!
,I hope this works for others as well.
,Protonix works wonders for me.
,I'd rather feel the pain.
,"I went from Lexapro which did not work to Cymbalta, which worked initially then stopped."
,I tried my migraine medicine again and took twice the usual dosage in one day and the headache left for two hours and came back EVEN WORSE!!
,"For years I just thought it was in my head, and my family constantly confirmed that fact."
,"Actually is a good depression reliever, completely removed the wolf just waiting at the back door."
,24 hours after missing a dose the withdrawal is really intense and you are really sick until about 3 hours after you take a dose.
,MY CURE: taking bile acid salts and full-strength pancreatic enzymes supplements with every meal.
,Cymbalta has definitely helped with my depression but the weight gain and depletion of my sex drive have definitely hurt my relationship.
,My joints never hurt before taking this medication.
,Did not give the drug ample time to see improvements for condition being treated.
,I'm glad I took it.
,"I can only think of one possible side effect, which is dizziness &/or lost seconds as I drive or type or write, because my mind will wonder to things that have nothing to do with what I am doing, as it is happening now due to Fatigue from this Fibro disease."
,I think it messed with my blood pressure because my head was throbbing with my pulse.
,Cymbalta was the only anti depressant that has ever worked for me.
,Neurologist didn't seem to care about my quality of life.
,"I WAS HAVING CHEST PAINS, MY BREATHING WAS SO MESSED UP THAT I WAS HYPERVENTALATING ALL THE TIME NOT TO MENTION PANIC ATTACKS."
,I feel a bit better in terms of handling my problems better and it has increased motivation (I didn't have any before).
,"Cymbalta has unquestionably been the best antidepressant I have ever taken (in 30+ years) - A few years ago, I failed all other antidepressants and combinations of various psychiatric drugs."
,I have 2 herniated back discs which were causing excruciating nerve pain and muscle spasms.
,The first time I thought I was having a heart attack so I took one and my Klonipin and within 4 hours my symptoms went away.
,"It's like they want you to be addicted, so you can stay a lifelong customer!"

,But I don't feel much of anything at all.
,"Feel a little zombie like, sweating (I normally did not) and do like the sexual side effects."
,"I was originally taking 20mg Celexa for depression due to my Divorce and other life issues, and that didn't seem to be doing much."
,And as soon as I started to get off the old feeling started coming back slowly.
,"I never had lot's of tender ""pain""; I mainly can't climb stairs or lift my arms and legs normally."
,"I realize this will not be the same for everyone, but it has worked very effectivley for me for some years now."
,"It worked well for depression, but I don't have major depression."
,I have requested the doctor request again to get Prevacid approved.
,"When I told him I thought I was having side effects from the Nexium, he blew me off and told me to continue to take it."
,"I must say that i felt the happiest i had ever felt in my life except for the extreme migraines,Due to the frequency of the migraines i discontinued cymbalta ,wish i could go back on it.I did suffer some withdrawl depressive symptoms after stopping the medicines but felt better in about two weeks"
,"Also, it's almost impossible to get off of."
,Nothing ever wrong with me.
,I recommend it highly to anyone.
,"I always come back to the nexium, when things improve I ween off it taking it once every other day for a while to get off of it."
,Was irritable and had tremors.I have been on Cymbalta for 11 days and today is the first day I did not need my Ativan.I am smiling and optimistic.
,I have never ever had this many reactions to a drug and I thought it was scary!!
,Now it's just a daily med I take and is no big deal.
,I had rapid weight gain because I would get seriously ill if I didn't eat several times a day.
,"Have taken previcid ,aciphex had to change due to insurance carrier no longer paid for it."
,"I started taking Cymbalta and after two weeks, I was feeling much better."
,Wait until you start to experience brain zaps.
,But I thought I need to do what the Dr. thought would help.
,"For my anxiety and fibro, it was fantastic."
,I had no recollection of the next day.
,While there has been some pain relief the side effects are more than I care to deal with.
,"He was very worried about possible thrombocytopenia, in addition to other ailments."
,I started becoming a total shut-in due to my FM symtoms so my Dr. recommended I try Cymbalta.
,But certainly not something that should be taken for a long time.
,It quickly eliminated the nausea I experienced after eating (due to an ulcer).
,I tried to get off of it once because I didn't like the fact that my sex drive decreased but everything came back and nothing else I've tried seems to work.
,I am starting to feel the pain go away.
,"I spent a lot of time in prayer over taking any type of antidepressant - i'm grateful God made people smart enough to make such a drug, and had my dr prescribe it."
,"I missed ONE side, ands all my symptoms came back within a day!"
,Kids would be up and going at 7:00am.
,"But I can't focus, concentrate and little stuff is driving me nuts."
,It's so hard to know what might be a side-effect and what might be something else.
,Works very well off label for nueropathy!
,After afew days of not taking it symptoms eased.
,"It lists ""arthritis aggravation""as a side effect."
,I cant go on like this another day.
,"So I was diagnosed with gastritis, and my doctor said it was good that I quit taking it, as the drug did cause these problems."
,So far no change in the ibs pain.
,OMG absolutely HORRIFIC!!!
,I am supposed to go to 60mg in two days but after reading the reports of the great difficulty in getting off Cymbalta - I am going to stop taking it before it gets even worse.
,I felt good although not like myself.
,the week before my period I don't go around changing my whole life because I'm feeling like things are lacking or kicking people out of my life because of my imagained beleifs of what they are thinking......
,I've never had indigestion so why take this stuff.
,"very bad chest pain abdominal pain .really really bad wind going to docs to try something else don,t trust it anymore"
,I was having heart palpitations all the time and my heart was constantly racing.
,Despite the first few weeks of side effects it really is a great help.
,i have taken cymbalta for the past one week.
,I am taking 20 mg once a day for depression and dysautonomia.
,"i took 80 mg of nexium / prilosec for 3 months and started having joint pain all over my body plus all kinds of stomach symptoms...i've been off of it for two weeks now and my wrists are starting to feel a bit better but my other joints still hurt....i had hip and back pain two years ago when i was on this drug and went away few months after i stopped, i went back on nexium 4 months ago again for heartburn and now I have pain in all my joints....i hate this"
,"It is a combination pack containing Nexium and two antibiotics - Amoxil (amoxycillin),Klacid (clarithromycin)which is used to treat this infection."
,And it hasn't helped my back pain at all
,A VERY BAD choice for me.
,I tried everything for my depression and this was the only thing that helped.
,Hope this ends soon.
,I cannot believe I found what the heck has been causing all these things to happen.I thought I was dying!!
,Getting used to it was difficult.
,i would not recommend this to anyone
,The side effects are so bad I don't know if I can keep taking it to get through the initial stages.
,Kept feeling like I was getting a urinary tract infection.
,So I went on-line and began to read patient comments about the drug.
,"Taking an Omega 3, 6 supplement helps with these effects."
,"Fortunately, I was able to ""stick it out"" until Monday when my psych."
,My mind is quiet.
,It's crazy because my father is able to tolerate this medication with just headaches.
,They progressively got worse to the point where I was pretty much indifferent about everything.
,Doctor moved me to H2-receptor but I am avoiding this and would rather live on antacids.
,I have stop taking nexium 38 hours ago.. come on anxiety go away.
,Not sure how long good parts will last at 30 though... we'll see....  (Total took for 5 mths about).
,"My Doctor said he would then try me on a lower dose, of 30mg, still the same feeings for me and the same side effects.Watch Out If You Have Heart Problems with Cymbalta!"
,"All she could explain to me was, studies done on Cymbalta."
,You won't regret it.
,Makes me wonder if any drug is good unless you have a raging bacterial infection and need an antibiotic!
,It did clear up the acid reflux but the side effects weren't worth it.
,"However, I have been on this medicine the longest and am most satisfied with the results."
,I hope this helps.
,I would not wish the side effects of discontinuing Cymbalta on my worst enemy.
,"I have tried so many natural approaches including accupunture-some helpful, but not lasting."
,Although I wonder if I went off of it whether I would then notice that it had been helping.
,Cymbalta was horrible to me.
,Decrease the acid and the pain will decrease was the operation definition.
,Haven't felt this good in years.
,"Great drug for depression, anxiety and OCD."
,Can anyone offer any suggestions.
,I have an appt.
,It was right after the 3rd week of being on the medication that I definitely noticed a positive benefit.
,"Overall, a good experience."
,"And earlier this week, I woke up with terrible neck, shoulder, and pain to the back of my head with a hot feeling that has lasted 6 days now."
,"On my first dose, I got sick to my stomach, but the sickness could have been from something I ate, since by day three, I felt much better."
,I love Cymbalta!
,"While on Nexium, the severe eye pain/pressure continued (MISERABLE)."
,I do hate this drug and have tried to get off for a year now.
,"I suddenly developed panic/anxiety disorder after over 30 years of being symptom-free, and during my first month before Cymbalta I was a wreck."
,"This stuff is heavy and I have been on a lot of anti-deprpessents and this works great but going off might not be worth it, I miss my Citalopram...but mostly I miss having access to medical care."
,I am so so happy with this drug- and follow the directions religiously.
,I have been on it for 4 days now & have noticed a few side affects.
,Taking it mid-day on a full stomach seems to be working for me most days.
,Lightheadedness and shoulder soreness were gone after a couple of weeks and other symptoms are fading quickly.
,"I stopped it 6 mos ago, cold turkey!"
,I was diagnosed with acid reflux and for approximately 3 years had taken prolosic.
,From reading other entries I am assuming I will be experiencing some terrible side effects by doing that...i'll have to call tomorrow and see if I should expect to feel bad.
,"My body thought it was time to go to sleep and so my appetite was gone, and I am not someone who needs to lose weight (high metabolism)."
,"Got a lot of samples, and after two  and a half weeks, I feel fantastic!"
,although it stopped some of the jitteryness.
,I'm even having a superbowl party although I have to get up early to work tomorrow.
,I have tried about fiver other anit-depressants and they all made me CRAZY.
,I am an extremely healthy 41 year old male.
,I also found it to pack less of a punch in terms of effectiveness than Zoloft.
,"Once I got my prescription deductable met, I gave in."
,Now I can hardly function without taking copious notes about everything - I just can't remember.
,it stopped working.
,This medicine sneaks up on you---without you even knowing it.
,"After 24 hrs from taking it I still feel queasy and weird, really drugged."
,"I just wish I could get out of the ""dream zone""."
,I suddenly got terrible bloating after everything  I ate.
,This drug has all but ruined my life.
,"After a miserable experience with discontinuation syndrome, even with slow tapering, I would strongly encourage anyone considering this drug to do a lot of research first."
,Have been using Omeprazole.
,I continued to the Nexium for a few more days until today.
,AMAZING!!!
,I thought I was losing my mind.
,I'm done with depression and am  all in for life!
,Head is so mucked up I can barely move or think.
,"I have really bad stomach problems, but the night time side effects were far worse."
,I had no idea at the time that this medicine has been known to help these kinds of symptoms.
,"Also, it doesn't 'flatten' my mood like other antidepressants have."
,I am taking nortriptyline for migraines but am having a ton of bad side effects and it is making my heart beat really fast which is concerning my doctors.
,The withdrawals are terrible.
,with no perceived +or- affect.
,i took 60 mg every morning with my adderall.
,"Since then, I have felt so much better."
,just a matter of finding the right thing for right person but as a precaution this is not one you quit easily.
,I have tken numerus medications and therapies before but none has helped me this much
,Migraine medicines NOT working and always has in the past.
,this is the worst part of every drug trip.
,That was over about 10 years ago with no side effects (no hot flushes etc.)
,I am not as tired.
,I was given Cymbalta 2 years ago to treat symptoms from a mild parasite infection(giardia)that was undiagnosed for a long time.
,"My body wasn't absorving the necessary nutrients it needed, vitamins didn't work, calcium didn't work."
,"But when it doesn't work, well, I firmly believe it will cause many suicides before the FDA wakes up."
,Very difficult to come off.
,"Cymbalta was discontinued when I was admitted and ""spells"" disappeared within 4 days."
,this has been horrible!
,It freaked me out and I am throwing the pills out.
,"I've suffered with PMDD for years, and I always know when I am about to start when the PMDD starts up."
,I went from someone who had turned off all her emotions to someone who can laugh and be passionate about life again.
,"PVC's gradually subsided but lasted for a couple months, also noticed I wasn't emptying my bladder completely."
,I admit I was taking diet pills too so that may have had an impact on that.
,I will have to tell her on my next appointment.
,Your brain doesn't come with a dipstick to measure the levels of neuro-transmitters!!!
,For the first time in a long time I felt normal.
,"Weight gain, which I hate!!"
,I agree that such violent reactions from your body cannot lead to anything good!
,"I must say, though, it did help me at a time when I really needed it!"
,I did not quit instantaneously and went for about 2 months taking less and less each week.
,this was going to be my last attempt at medication.
,My doctor advised against it but I weaned myself off anyway.
,HORRIBLE DRUG.
,Considering going off meds.

,Been on about 6 months and it has helped a lot.
,I have had to stop taking other medications due to the gas.
,"I have been suffering from the debilitating effects of PMDD for nearly a year, and decided to seek medical attention to improve my quality of life."
,I will never take another Nexium tablet as long as I live.
,Update from 6/30 posting - combination of remeron (15mg) and cymbalta (20mg) work beautifully and I am sleeping again and depression is GONE.
,A recent medical study confirmed my suspicion that these acid reducing drugs can cause ostioporosis.
,I wish that my physician would had warned me of what the effects and the initial phases of the medication would be because it would have been easier to adapt.
,I have an appt with a new Psych so hopefully he will be able to find something comparable w/o these terrible side effects.
,Several times in the past 5 years I have forgotten to take it before bed.
,I don't think I want to give it time to work better based on all the side effects that don't seem to be going away for most users that are using this website.
,I do not recommend this medication for anyone!
,"I've been on this drug for 20 days now, I have missed some days however."
,I'll go back to old school prozac if have too.
,I've only taken one short nap at work so far today & my yawns have been normal.
,"Started 30 MG - 1st night, horrible nausea."
,"I have tried many things to remedy the acidity such as Papaya, Acid cider vinegar (tablets), aloe vera, and ginger root extract - all of which seem to help."
,"I believe my reflux is caused primarily by stress, so looking into meditation."
,"I don't want to settle and be stoic or have ""less"" sadness."

,"So for me, this drug has been wonderful, but concerns of liver damage keep me getting regular liver studies"
,It will just stop working all of a sudden and coming off of it is worse than anything you can imagine.
,"This is no way to live, I will be discontinuing use & pray that my body will be able to heal some damage."
,But no it was withdrawl from this medication and then it caused an overdose on my other medication (Trazadone)since they were not both in my system working together.
,I should have followed my instincts about taking this very new drug.
,Suicidal - freak out - PAIN in the BRAIN.
,I truly cannot believe I resisted this for so long.
,"I can't sleep, my feet hurt, I can't get rid of my migraine, I feel full all of the time... the list goes on."
,Now I am functioning better and only think about headaches when I get them.
,I took this drug for 8 weeks and have now been off it for 8 weeks.
,I would choose heartburn anyday.
,I nejoy my coffee again.
,Side effects?
,I didn't but just skipping a day was horrible.
,I suffered so much pain throughout my body that I suspected that I had cancer or heart problems.
,Took it at night for a week and sleep was ok.
,"Another three years has passed, and I'm due for a third."
,I had to go cold turkey because I could not get the drug anymore due to financial problems and I don't know what to do to help myself in this situation.
,"Just days after starting the medicine, I could tell a difference in my anxiety & patience levels."
,I am concerned though that I have gained 19 pounds in the last three months (have been taking this for about 6).
,Be observant!!
,It DOES cause weight gain...at least is has for me.
,It is truly evil!
,The withdrawals are severe.
,"I don't trust the FDA one little bit and if there are this many side effects that are present immediately, what will come later?"
,I put my life and others lives in danger.
,I am not hungry and often remind myself its time to eat.
,Was amazed when heartburn stopped on very first day of taking.
,I will either be too hot or almost immediately feeling chilly no matter what I do.
,I have to withdraw again I am scared because it was hell the last time.
,Due to feeling horrible (recent back and right hip pain) decided to look up my meds to check any other side effects except those listed.
,to a tblsp.
,Came off  Nexium as it did not help and scared of losing hair again.
,"Insomnia worse, sleep interruption and sleeping in worse."
,It has also helped with the depression but has not fully resolved it.
,Confidence is up and I'm less likely to be overly-sensitive.
,It has caused me to be severely fatigued with flu-like symptoms that came on about 24 hours after beginning this drug.
,"Wow, great med that decreased my smoking to less than a pack a day from 2 packs a day."
,"I guess it did affect my brain chemicals, but in a rellly BAD way."
,I do recommend trying everything else first then when you need give it a whirl be prepared to stick it out for the chance at the full benefit .
,The withdrawls are God awful.
,"I did research, and found out that no matter how I did it, I was going to be sick."
,I wouldn't recommend this drug to anyone.
,I was very angry for a long time.
,Went to my GP who thought I may have had a stroke.
,"I took 60mg for only 2 days then went back to 30 mg for a few days, then stopped taking it all together."
,"Luckily I have a ""stand by"" prescription of Xanax for the anxiety."
,The Good News-- it helped my depression.
,I don't know what to do about the side-effects that happened once I stopped taking it.
,"at 40 mg., the severe vertigo and dizziness started one morning."
,I would rather have the pain I had before starting this medication.
,I am going to begin tapering off of this tonight now that I know to remove seven beads a day.
,"about 7:30 I developed anxiety, felt stoned, hyper--yet could not stop yawning (I was not tired--this would be a form of a tic), and generally felt very ""out of it"" in addition to the earlier symptoms."
,Doctors need to be aware of this and explain the adverse effects to patients instead of us paying so much and having to do our own research.
,Of course I haven't had to try to get off of it yet.
,I would rather deal w the acid reflux than the pain and suffering of the last 6 months!
,After 8 years on this terrible drug I saw many specialists and had many tests over a period of 3 months.
,"When I realized it had the potential to slow down/cease calcium absorbtion, that was the final straw."
,This drug will cause you to gain weight and keep it.
,I told my Dr. that I was feeling this way but was brushed off.
,Woukd not take this again long term.
,If this burning continues in my throat I will stop taking this medicine and try the apple cider vinegar and the orange peel extract that someone else on here recommended.
,Third week added 60 mg of cymbalta.
,I got so woozy and dizzy I left work at 10 a.m. and then laid on the couch the rest of the day alternately sleeping and staring at the TV.
,"Doctor took me off the Cymbalta, prescribed taking 1/2 cap."
,"With having a family history of both esophogeal and stomach cancer, I was panicked when diagnosed with Barretts, which is a an early warning for cancer."
,I JUST WITH IT DID NOT COST SO MUCH.
,"No more crying, virtually no more pain, I suffer with a great deal of pain everyday, and have been taking also narcotic pain meds, that still didn't work as well as Cymbalta."
,"I immediately called my gp and since I was traveling at the time, was rx'd an antibiotic."
,Other PPI's had pretty much the same effect on me as the Nexium as he had me try them all to see which one would be best suited for me.
,"I've had no nausea, and no headache."
,These symptons continued to get worse even after I stopped the medication.
,"I am going to see an ENT next week-- HOWEVER-- I must say that as one woman posted on here, I have not been able to leave my house."
,"I could not think or talk, I felt paranoid, and terrified to be alone with my own children and totally not in control of my thoughts or actions."
,The tiredness is what is finally compelling me to get off this medication (although the weight gain is also contributing to this).
,Things that I would obsess over before no longer are a concern.
,The first week of withdrawal was hell.
,I was on the 60 mg dose and it worked for awhile.
,"They ""don't know"" how it works to block pain."
,"I suffered from depression for 15 plus years, including 3 major depressive episodes with suicide attempts, and then dysthimia (sp?)."
,This is the first one that has me interested in life again (am taking 60 mg).
,"Meanwhile, because people stigmatize drug use for legitimate pain, they must suffer from not using time=tested pain medications."
,I had been on Prozac and Lexapro for years.
,Nexium has made me miserable.
,"wasted my time with this medication, did not help depression in anyway, caused increased fatigue which only made mood worse, cymbalta is nothing ""novel"" just another SNRI antidpressant"
,I cannot say a bad word about Nexium.
,Very hopeful this will work.
,DO NOT TAKE!!!
,It truly felt as if I was losing my mind and my physical body as well.
,I feel antisocial and have a hard time relating to a lot of people.
,I couldn't drive safely or perform at work.
,"Just started on nexium, after 4 years of Prilosec."
,As soon as I got off cymbalta I lost 30lbs instantly without doing anything.
,"I was a Gym Junkie, extremely fit and energetic."
,It gets my vote for best dosage.
,Don't go anywhere no desire.
,"Soon after starting the Cymbalta, I started noticing that I was getting headaches every day, around the same time."
,I hope others have the success I feel I am having because right now I feel great!
,All i could think about was the movie Jacob's Ladder when I took this drug.
,Also Cymbalta has been aproved for fibromyalgia.
,It was the body snatcher called Cymbalta.
,I had no adverse withdrawal side effects from either Zoloft or Celexa; however Cymbalta was a different story.
,"Whilst this drug helped me to begin with I feel that the longer I am on it the worse I am becoming in regards to my memory, lethargy, libido and now anger is also becoming an issue."
,I am now trying to wean off this medication due to weight gain and cost.
,In the last three years I have had two major surgeries and a great deal of stress.
False,"CYMBALTA needs to be more clear about all this but I believe the drug company dont want you to TRY coming off these so they only push the ""POSSIBLE"" (note: not probable!)"
,"After this time, I had to get my own."
,I am looking to be on Cymbalta for a long time.
,"I took Cymbalta, I LOVED IT."
,"After 3 months of constant vomiting, diarrhea, and nausea I decided to see the Dr. She prescribed Nexium thinking of GERD or possibly an Ulcer."
,The acid reflux comes back with a vengeance.
,"But after my body adjusted, I did notice quite a difference in my anxiety, and length of dressions bouts."
,"The Nexium, however, completely stopped my daily heartburn."
,I am very thankful for Cymbalta!
,"The insomnia was unbearable, and I was on edge with anxiety."
,It did help with the depression but the withdrawals are almost worth not taking it.
,24/7 pain is gone
,"Cymbalta has helped me feel lots better mentally, somewhat better physically -- it greatly helped my chronic neck pain, but did nothing for my lower back pain."
,I really feel like my old self again.
,I was taking 40mg rt before more my meal.
,"I feel dizzy a lot, and I have this sort of white noise noise in my brain much of the time."
,I miss me!
,I really felt pretty doped up.
,"To me, the benefits outweigh any risk, but will certainly pay attention to any possible side effects and adjust dosage accordingly."
,Did stop briefly taking it because  of the sleepiness but the pain came back big time.
,Within 3 days my mood brightened; within 2 wks the headaches have subsided.
,"I was on Paxil throughout high school, took a break from meds and then couldn't stand it anymore."
,the pain is WAY down - using along with TENS unit.
,God help anyone that takes this medication for depression.
,I warned her about Cymbalta.
,Withdrawal was pure hell.
,"After struggling with symptoms for more than six months, I was finally prescribed Nexium for my problems."
,"Dizzy, light headed, foggy brain, just stoned!"
,"Try this, because your boweles can not function without enough minerals."
,I am worried that this is not a safe medication.
,Pushed on through the first few rough days and after the first week I felt ok.
,The body zaps made me sick.
,The Cymbalta simply stopped working for me.
,My pulmonologist had me on this to help with my gerd which flares up my asthma attacks....He said the diahrea was a side effect of this medication.
,"I also starting taking a natural, whole food/green food, multi vitamin for women as I began the weaning process and plan to continue with that."
,He suspected H.Pylori (came back negative) and bacterial infection from eating raw food.
,It seems a lot of what people experience with this is patient-specific as it works well for some and not for others...there are also many psychosomatic issues to consider as well when reading these comments.
,I wont go into all the problems since these can be found in my other entry.
,"I am sleeping better, have more energy and decreased appetite."
,I had taken Prozac for about 2 years for anxiety and felt that it was time for a change because I couldn't feel it helping my situation.
,the vertigo/dizziness is unrelenting!
,Sorry for my bad English.
,I hate this drug!
,"It took about 2 weeks, but I was the happiest person ever for the first 4 months."
,"My only concern is that it is so hard to come off of, I've tried several times with no luck."
,This is a side effect I enjoy.
,"After I started taking it (can't remember just when) I noticed by stomach becoming less tolerant to spicy food, alcohol and pain relievers (occasionally for sinus headache)."
,"I was diagnosed with GERD in 1992 and had tried other drugs:  Zantac, Prilosec, Prevacid, Aciphex and Protonix."
,I told him I didn't feel right and he asked if I was drunk and said I was slurring.
,"Yeah, Depression Hurts but I never felt worse."
,"I wasn't stressed anymore, but my self-esteem was shot as I thought I was the most boring person ever."
,"Later, I experienced constipation."
,I watch what I eat and I work out 4 times per week average.
,horribly expensive.
,I’m over it now and slowly getting back my health.
,"It took me a good 4 months before I was back to normal, working normally."
,I have also been depressed which I hope will go away now that I have stopped taking this drug.
,I was more calm and didn't let things stress me out.
,That's just my opinion.
,"Within a few days of leaving the hospital I began having panic attacks, which is extremely uncharacteristic for me."
,I also cut my food portions by half.
,Cymbalta gave me back my life.
,I get to taper down to 30mg in about 3 weeks then eventually get back to normal life
,No big side effects from taking the drug(30 mg/day) other than zero sex drive.
,They started me on samples of Protonix but insurance would'nt cover when they wrote script.
,I seem to be a little better...at least am willing to go to work and not picking fights with my family anymore.
,After reading the Cymbalta ratings of one.
,"It's just a matter of how effective nexium is, from person to person."
,That only lasted a day though.
,On day 14 (3 days after having stopped taking Nexium) I still have muscle aches but no abdominal cramps or fever.
,I noticed a benefit from the drug within the first few days and felt like a new person within a couple of weeks.
,I never tried other AD.
,"My doc is at a loss to explain and wants to refer me to a host of additional specialists (rheumatology, neurology, physiatrist, etc.)."
,?feel free to e-mail any advice.
,Started taking about 2 months ago.
,i felt more like myself.
,I work in the medical field and truly wish I would have done more research instead of just trying the newest drug that hit the market.My dr recommended Cymbalta and said that he's heard great things from his patients that have been on this med.
,"Coming off Cymbalta does sound scary, but I am trying to just enjoy feeling well for now, will cross that bridge down the road."
,This is the first medication to truly work for my depression.
,The side effects are pretty bad.
,Cymbalta works well for me.
,"It seemed to work for a while as I was able to eat normally, however I immediately started having anxiety (which I have never had before) and did not realize it was the Nexium until recently."
,I FEEL YOUNG AGAIN.
,This happened to me.
,There was no benefit to my depression at all  And the worst side effect has been the desire to sleep 10 - 20 hours a day and then total apathy about everything and anything.
,"To anyone that is trying it and experiencing some of the dizziness and nausea, I encourage you to stick it out...It DOES get better!"
,"I decided on surgery, screw the pills."
,"I had to abruptly stop taking lyrica and experienced severe gastrointestinal disturbance (kind way of putting it), huge emotion swings, weight loss."
,It helped the pain but all I want to do is sleep and eat.
,Have since tried to other meds.
,That is also very scary.
,I took prozac instead of the cymbalta and that helped alot.
,I love this med!
,"I had a headache for ages and put it down to migraines (which i suffer from)I was down in the dumps a bit, now i wont say depressed because i have been depressed and it wasnt that bad."
,I still have some muscle pain but it has improved along with my overall attitude while using Cymbalta.
,After 2 months I am feeling mentally normal again.
,Anyone considering the drug....HEAVENLY at first (can work miracles for depression)but HELL in the end....   Bottom line: I want OFF!!!!
,"The symptoms I had were worse when I felt dehydrated, and improved much when I drank more water."
,But I hear I'm a fun drunk...
,This is the best I've felt--MUCH less pain--than I have for years.
,"I was diagnosed with depression at five years old, and have been on three other medications besides Cymbalta."
,Then after 9 mos.
,Please try it because you are worth it.
,"Sometimes feel JOY - dancing around the house, energetic, feel good about myself, most times just feel balanced, calm."
,I'm really sick of all of the costly and apparently unneccessary medical testing.
,Have been stuck for weeks in a completely flat emotional state...letting everything go including my diabetes.
,We decide to try something different in my research I found this site.
,The person perscribing it didn't describe it properly.
,I was taking 90 mg daily and decided to wean off the drug.
,I can function like a human being.
,I'm so angry and irritable that I can't stand it.
,The worst part of Lamictal was how manic it made me.
,I FEEL HUMAN!!!
,"my brain does not connect well with my body or my mouth, I get confused about mostly everything, I am a college graduate who can no longer read more then a page or two and forget all of what I read."
,It doesn't cure all but it helps me have a better life.
,Most side effects disapeared after 3 days.
,Hoping no permanent damage to my bones.
,I did not toerate it so the docs lowered the dose again.
,Today is Monday.
,It was almost difficult to be sad about anything.
,I can think clearly and focus more on what is important.
,"So far, this drug has helped me."
,For me it is the only drug in its class which has virtually obliterated my anxiety and panic attacks.
,This is day 5 since I stopped the 30mg cymbalta and i must say..i feel TERRIBLE!
,"Went to the doctor the next day and of course,after all kinds of stress tests, they could find nothing wrong."
,i feel almost like a complete person.
,"ENT familiar with problems associated with Nexium but, with surgeon, felt that if I could stay on it 3 months, healing would be better."
,5 months later and still have some PVCs which are not controlled but better.
,"If I wasn't pissed, I was crying."
,Does anyone fill the same way?
,this is my second pass at cymbalta.
,I had to go off Cymbalta due to the expense.
,"I'm not getting the same ""feel good"" as I once did."
,The most startling side effect was the change in body odor.
,I had two doctors warn me about Cymbalta but my main doc wanted me to try anyway.
,This medication has really helped my anxiety but the insomnia is a problem.
,In the past I have taken zoloft which I could not tell that it helped with the depression.
,I strongly suggest finding an alterior method of acid control.
,Doctors are trained the same way and they cannot see things any other way.
,I started taking 20MG of Nexium once daily 6 months ago for GERD.
,If I have any problems with this I will ask for a new Dr. since the one I have now does not care what he prescribes.
,I am not looking forward to the day when I have to wean myself from the medicienes however I was feeling so poorly that I felt I needed the relief I've found with the combo my doctor has prescribed.
,My NEW neuro (headache specialist) recommended the one drug that I feared worse than death - CYMBALTA.
,"If I had any idea how bad the withdrawl would be, I never would have taken this."
,"I have sufferred for years with my illness, tried multiple meds."
,"I didn't sleep a wink, even after I got up and took 2 Unisom capsules."
,"The side effects finally overtook what little ""good"" the pills were doing, & after trying to taper & still experiencing withdrawal, I decided I might as well go cold turkey."
,"I then began experiencing muscle spasms in my hands, arm and leg muscle weakness, depression, a rash on my neck, and I started having trouble typing at my computer at work."
,So here is the picture.
,STOP TAKING IT NOW - DR KP (Melbourne Dentist)
,Was taking Celexa and it seemed to just stop working.
,"FELT great on this medication, depression lifted quickly and headaches gone in 3 days."
,"Relieved to know I'm not alone, yet FREAKED OUT at the same time!!"
,I took 30mg caps...
,However muscle spasms/cramps now keep me from sleeping.Once muscle spasm resolves an ache continues for hours afterwards.
,"My appetite is returning, no more stomach pains and it seems like I’m digesting my food again."
,THANKS CYMBALTA!
,     You are better off taking Malox or Zantac to help your acid reflux.
,My Dr could not figure it out.
,Withdrawals were WORSE than side effects!
,I was really bummed because the cymbalta acutally helped my fibromyalgia pain from day 1.
,"I'm not sure if that means the Nexium effects last a lot longer than just the daily pill, or what."
,to me....id rather have feelings....I want off this drug.
,"With my very first capsule, I slept like a baby."
,My dr is insistant that I take something for everything I am going through.
,I constantly have suicidal thoughts and my self harming worsened on these drugs.
,"I've battled with PPD and major depression since first getting pregnant 4 years ago, which took a sharp turn for the worse within weeks after giving birth."
,He wished DEATH upon my Son!
,I was put on 60 mg. and have been in my own hell ever since.
,WITHDRAWL HELL
,I have gone through 2 serious depression episodes in my life.
,"Probably should have weaned off a bit longer, but it's behind me now."
,"They have a ""PILL"" for everything these days.........makes you wonder!"
,I feel my depression and anxiety is worse because of bad side effects.
,Sadly February the side effects were beginning to take hold.
,upping my dosage to 80 mg has made it much better.
,Avoid Cymbalta at all costs!
,I took the small dose of 30mg at bedtime.
,I feel my side effects undermined my professional performance and casual conversation.
,"Meanwhile, I try not to stand or walk too long to avoid the pain."
,Thanks for the postings; it would have been easy to dismiss Nexium as the cause of my discomfort without this forum!
,After just about 2 weeks the side effects disappeared and I haven't felt this good in a long time.
,"I would not, however, say that my mood has lifted, just that the mood swings are less severe."
,Hope I get my memory  back and my sleep.
,"It also helped with my anxiety for a while, but if I skipped a dose even less than a day I would have bad side effects such as dizziness, anxiety, very irratable, nausea, and a thumping sensation in my tongue."
,Nexium caused my body to stop absorbing any nutrients.
,I have felt an ever increasing sense of lethargy and tiredness.
,"I'm stepping down slowly and even doing that, I've experienced dizzyness, headaches...everything I mentioned to the point where I can't function."
,"I was moody, picked arguments, was angry and just so tense, nothing like myself at all."
,Even went to a vascular surgeon who performed veinous closure procedure on my leg.
,It seems like my body has adjusted and its lost its effectiveness while causing me to lose my hair.
,"I mentioned this to my doc and his nurse and they just, oh yeah."
,"Not until about 3 days ago I've always thought these ""symptoms"" coincide with my depression."
,Other than the constipation...
,"Especially, if u smoke marijuana."
,Started with 40mg; Nexium was a Godsend.
,I have taken Zoloft for 3 years and Wellbutrin for 2 years.
,This is NOT an appropriate reaction.
,Terrible side effects.
,Will wait to see.
,However the uncontrollable shaking really scared me.
,This is a new problem for me and I suspect the cymbalta.
,I have only allowed myself to drive the past couple of day.
,"Brain fog, dizzy, more anxiety, short term memory gone, exhaustion all the time."
,"And for those on here who have already mentioned this - I agree, this stuff is lethal."
,The increase in dosage didn't provide as significant relief as when I first started the drug.
,Literally!
,Another nose bleed a few days later when i was blowing my nose.
,"Not unbearable, more annoying than anything, but I'm not sure how to stop myself from clenching when I don't even realize I'm doing it."
,"And as I mentioned earlier, I've never experienced anxiety like that in my life until I started the Nexium."
,Before I wanted to hide under the cover all day.
,"I only too 1 dose of 30mg, and within about 2 hours I was curled up in fetal position from nausea."
,At 60mgs all his pain left.
,But the side effects are a little unnerving.
,I tried to get out of bed and could hardly stand.
,I recommend that you talk to your doctor before stopping this drug.
,Advice?
,"When saw doctor, she immediately switched me off Cymbalta to Effexor to stabilize the depression."
,My depression is partly situational as I am no longer able to work.
,Now researchers have found that taking Nexium over a prolonged period of time (years) can cause C-Dif.
,Cymbalta may not be right for you but don't stop trying to find one that is.
,This drug was successful combined with therapy to assist me in fully recovering from this depressive episode and I discontinued it 5 or 6 months later.
,I took ONE PILL and within an hour or so felt all wrong.
,"I'm about to work my way off of it, with the help of a doctor."
,I am trying to stick with the medication but I may have to go off of it and try something different:/ I was put on this medication for migraines so helping the anxiety was just an added benefit.
,"After a few weeks, I was at a friends house and started using a punching bag and it felt great!"
,Simple dietary changes are ALL IT TAKES people.
,I think I'll give it another couple of weeks and then go off of it which I am not looking forward to based on the withdrawal I've read about.
,"In addition I changed the following: Everytime I feel the heartburn or reflux I have a few almonds (I have about 20/day; I buy them in 1kg packs), I have dinner at 6pm and never eat anything for 4hrs before I go to bed; I never drink anything 30min before or after a meal."
,"Loss of sleep led to anxiety and depression, I became unable to work, ended crying of despair."
,"If I miss a day, I do have weird withdrawals though."
,in 4 months.
,Wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy except to the Doctor who recommended this drug!!
,"I know some people do well, but I have seen serotonin drugs prescribed for so many things and every single person I know that has taken them have had really bad experiences."
,This has helped me immensely and the effects that it has had on my life were worth the side-effects for the first couple of months.
,"By lunchtime, my co-workers were making comments that I ""had too much coffee""."
,Not anymore!
,"Have tried just about every SSRI out there and have never, ever, experienced ""side effects"" anything like this."

,Also I feel emotionally flat on Cymbalta.
,HELP!

,"After a year my depression started to return and my dosage was increased to 60mg, however, I was recently married and the sexual side effects were causing problems, so I am in a transitioning period of my medications currently"

,All I read and was told is that Nexium caused dizziness.
,I have lost weight but maintained by normal appetite
,"However, remember that everyone is different and out of ALL those taking this medication only 20-30% end up with severe side effects if any at all."

,ENT and GI docs love to prescribe this.
,"I do have a history of depression, nerve pain and arthritis."
,I was choking (from food getting stuck in my esopheogus) on a daily basis.
,"I already have eliminated just about everything I can in the diet, but am also going to try to lose some weight to see if that helps."
,My Mom took this med for depression for several months with NO improvement.
,Please really taking what i am saying into consideration.
,The depression has decreased.
,Perhaps there is no magic bullet.
,"Went off of Effexor last Nov. because I am now on SSD and couldn't afford Effexor,  my doctor has been giving me samples of the Cymbalta."
,noticed change in a day or two.
,Major PANIC ATTACKS!
,After 10 days of being off Cymbalta I am still having serious problems with my GI tract.
,I took prevacid for two years with no side effects.
,"mood is ""upgraded"" to medium and stable, works well for my pain, some muscle tightness, palpitaions--but nothing as bad as Effexor (seizure) or Paxil (unable to stand up)."
,Psych Doc told me to take at p.m.
,"I took Zoloft and Xanax for about 6 months, but the combination made me feel like Frankenstein."
,"After reading all the negative comments I was hesitant to try Cymbalta, in fact I almost didn't take it."
,Also my head has this weird feeling like I want to put a hat on to keep it from sort of coming out... doesn't make sense but it's feels really weird.
,We didn't even think about the drug causing these side effects as there was nothing on the info sheet.
,"he's not interested in anything or anyone.he's put on weight, no interested in sex, sits on his chair and watches tv  then falls asleep,very grumpy, his depression has stsrted to return."
,The insurance company stopped covering it so I had the GERD surgery which 'cured' me until recently.
,I went back up to 60mg and cancelled the sleep study because I'm afraid to go off this drug.
,"Then there is a decrease in sex drive, longer time to climax and when I do it's not as intense."
,"today especially i am having shortness of breath so i called the ENT who put me on nexium and he said that he's never heard of anyone having these side effects before and i need to either be evaluated by my primary or go to the ER, however i see alot of people have the same complaints."
,I have severe spinal stenosis and spend most of my life in severe pain.
,"I felt like I was producing MORE acid, not less and suffering severe acid reflux as a result."
,"IF THE ABOVE SYMPTONS GO AWAY "" I'LL BE BACK"" TO THANK EVERYONE!!!"
,Much better than prevacid or dexilant.
,Only took three doses and NO MORE for me.
,"Maybe some mild neausea, but I'm not even sure the meds was the cause."
,I have tried many over the counter drugs in between refilling my prescription for Nexium and within a week I am feeling ill again.
,I am now able to read an instruction manuel with no problem and operate my computer and camera with ease.
,"Then, a DoctoR took me off all drugs for about three weeks---I had no problems but started taking Nexium again and within a week STARTED suffering from all the above."
,"I've tried a variety of SSRIs, and now I'm wondering why my doc had me bother with them."
,check out the BLTC Good Drug Guide.
,"i take nexium 40 mg for about 5 years now,after read all comments now i just wake up my self about why i feel so tired like that, with back and head pain,anxious.have to take some ativan and effexor for 2 years because i was depressiv,and feel like i will dye i go to the hospital about 5 times because i got some panic attack ,stop working for 15 months because i was depressive.i want to try to stop nexxium just to see if its the reason why i feel like that.sorry for fault im frech from montreal,quebec,canada.thanks patrick"
,All I want to do is sleep and I never feel rested.
,I'll post again after being on it awhile longer.
,I switched to Cymbalta because Wellbutrin seemed to stop working but after taking this i feel it may have been helping me after all.
,I used to eat out of boredom but now I'm doing other stuff.
,I don't cry as much which is a bonus but I do feel like crying at times during the day and I really hoped to be feeling much much better at the 11 week stage.
,"This is a hard drug to stick with, I was REALLY sick at first."
,After eating the pain gets much worse.
,I will ask more questions if there is ever a next time to be weaned off a medication.
,"Over time, i just stopped caring about anything."
,"PLEASE - be careful with Cymbalta and all other SSNRIs/SSRIs, report all side effects, withdraw VERY SLOWLY - dizziness, ""brain zaps"", blackouts are inevitable result of withdrawing too quickly from all of this class, ONE MUST SHAVE PILLS DOWN BY CRUMBS IN DECREASING DOSE OVER LONG PERIOD OF TIME WHEN WITHDRAWING, A MG. AT A TIME - IF THIS IS NOT FOLLOWED CLOSELY, DANGEROUS AND UNPLEASANT WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME (SEROTONIN SYNDROME) RESULTS, AS SO MANY OF US HAVE REPORTED AND ARE FAMILIAR WITH!!!"
,Working out every other day so I can stay on it this combination.
,"I have a very high tolerance for drugs, and I have been on meds almost consistently for thirteen years, trying almost everything possible."
,Unfortunately it wasn't a good fit for me at all.
,It's disheartening how this gastro dr. handed me a bag of it without any explanation at all-- and the nurse has to tell me how to take it.
,I was only on the medicine for about a week before I couldn't deal with the side effects any longer.
,anyway xanax-between .50mg.
,I was so excited because I han't felt
,My only gripe is the weight gain.
,This med helped my depression and relieved my anxiety to a certain extent.
,"My libido also just did a disappearance act, which I simply couldn't handle."
,I started experiencing chest pains as well(mild).
,I itch.
,I have more energy.
,"Nausea, severe headache, flu-like aches, panic attacks, disoriented, brain zaps, ""whooshing"" feeling, vertigo, dizziness."
,Wouldn't trade it for anything right now.
,I WISH I HAD KNOWN more about this awful drug before I Took it...I WOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN IT.
,Stupid me.
,After 2 years still dizzy and balding.
,My doctor prescribed Cymbalta at first for my extreme Irritable Bowel Syndrome.
,"As the day progresses I develop severe anxiety, dizziness, instability."
,Cymbalta slowly pulled me out of the darkness and I've developed a sex drive for the first time in 15 years.
,I feel like the benefits of Cymbalta are the reason I decided to try medication (I hate taking medication).
,I am now currently on Wellbutrin and I like it way much more than Cymbalta.
,I changed from paxil to cymbalta after having possible TIA or mild stoke (only a small spot showed on the Brain Scan in the right frontal lobe-Overnight I had temporary slurred speach and permanently lost part of my ability to remember).
,"If I take the med late or forget a dose within 12 hrs, I develop withdrawal symptoms."
,doctors thought it was a heart attack but blood test showed no evidence of an M.I.
,this is by far the WORST ad i have ever taken.
,Since then my anxiety has went through the roof.
,"As I just went down to half dosage 5 days ago, today (day 5), that intense shoulder pain is back."
,"I took the last dose 6 weeks ago and I am still having major withdrawal symptoms of dizziness, irritability, loose stools, crazy ""zapping"" feeling that goes thru my head, ringing in my ears, headaches, blurry vision and stomach cramps."
,"Everyone thinks I am just a nut case- crying, depression, confusion.... sobbing-- I won't go anywhere w/o someone coming w/ me and I can't drive b/c of the ear ringing and vertigo."
,It was suggested I take a PPI but I didn't want to take any more pills because I am so sensitive to side effects.
,Tried prozac and lexapro too.
,It has been like reclaiming my life after a long hibernation.
,"2 yrs ago, my legs and feet started getting numb."
,I feel that strongly about this!
,Sleeping 13 hours at night and then napping during the day.
,"I was prescribed this medicine to help with depression and anxiety, but the side effects are awful."
,My doctor said you cant do anything about the nausea/dizziness because its the brain thats effected and you just have to wait it out.
,NO paid meds needed now.
,It's more related to pain and this drug did not do much for the pain.
,"For the first 3 weeks, life was getting a lot easier and I started to hope that I was going to come out of that long tunnel of depression."
,It helped my depression so very well for a while.
,I sleep a deeper sleep instead of feeling disrupted.
,At one point I increased my dosage on Nexium from 20 to 40 mg and it is working very well for me.
,Really annoyed that the Dr who prescribed it dimisses my concerns and symptons as anxiety or pre menopausal.
,"I wouldn't reccommend this drug to anyone, but as antidepressants are, it can be different for everyone and it takes time to find the right one (which I'm not sure exists for me)."
,They were worried about my mental state.
,I have had Fibromyalia and Neuropathy for 25 years and heard that Cymbalta is a life saver because it helps with the nerve pain and the depression that goes along with have the pain 24/7 so I thought what the hell I'll give it a shot.
,I'm HAPPY!
,I have been on SSRI's before but never an SNRI.
,Have lost about 10 lbs thus far.
,"Back in June, I went to the doctor for acid reflux..he prescribed me omeprazole for the reflux."
,"The morning after I woke to terrible lower back pain, hip joint pain, and pain running down what felt like the center of my thighs."
,"6 Months: Things settled I thought 'I Love Cymbalta',Something finally worked."
,I can tell a big difference from the drug.
,I see the doc every 6 weeks for medication mgmt.
,"I had flashbacks last night of my childhood, and it was all good memories."
,"My acid reflux had damaged my throat, esophagus, stomach and colon."
False,"After about 20 minutes, the symptoms seemed to improve and I was finally able to get up and get a neighbor to run me to the ER."
,"Since I've been on the medication, my spirits seem to be uplifted & I'm just happier in general."
,"And this is at a ""top"" medical institution in the country."
,I was beginning to wonder if this drug was draining my adrenals.
,For me these are the 3 most important changes I made to deal with my hiatas hernia.
,I did have withdrawl headaches but nothing to bad.
,Worked amazingly well for anxiety and depression when combined with clonazepam.
,"I do, though, have an extreme use of appetite and frequent night sweats."
,I would not recommend cymbalta to anyone.
,It has worked better than any other medicine of this type.
,"What a welcome relief, after 16 years of anti-depressants which totally killed my sex drive."
,Coping with work and stress has surely  improved.
,Know thyself and learn as much as you can.
,"If it keeps working, I will be back in a week to give it a full5 instead of just a 4 rating!"
,Back pain went from 6-8 level to 1-3 level.
,"Cymbalta also lessens menstrual cramps and lower back pain for me; although, I still take NSAIDS for both occasionally (even"
,I would not recommend Nexium to anyone at this time.
,"The side effects all stink, and the things such as weight gain (I've gained at least 20 pounds!)"
,"For the last week I took Cymbalta, I had chronic diarrhea."
,This med has really helped me.
,"Unfortunately, I have not lost the 15 extra pounds from Lexapro!"
,Its been a nasty ride & its not letting up.
,"20 mg. Celexa worked well for menopause, without side effects that seem to affect the entire body."
,I missed a dose last week and boy howdy was that freaky.
,I will NEVER take this drug again.
,I have been experiencing mild reflux for the last couple of months and the Dr statred me on this drug.
,I'd much rather deal with heartburn.
,"He next tried Lamictal, and after tapering up for over a month, at 150mg per day I was feeling slightly motivated to leave the house, but the med made me short tempered, nasty, did not help anxiety and the crazy side effects like acne, weight gain, mouth sores etc."
,"I will try homeopathy and other natural remedies but most of all, it is better to deal with other issues in our lives such as stress and emotions in order to get genuine healing."
,I didn't make the connection to cymbalta until my OBGYN told me that it had originally been developed as a drug for incontinence!
,I don't know.
,"The doc did not want to hear about the brain issues she just wanted to up the dosage to address pain issue( again the ""survey"")."
,Helped with depression but no lessen in pain from fibro.
,I eventually didn't want to play World of Warcraft anymore(most addictive drug ever).
,"Did not like taking Xanax, but ""had"" to take it for the feeling of heart racing."
,"I'll try 90mg for a few months and see how it works out, then I'd like to wean off of it."
,I am hoping it wont get worse.
,If only they could develop these pain drugs without the horrible side effects.
,And my
,The brain zaps are the worst of all and I can't sleep.
,"The GERD started to get worse in July 07 and I started on the Nexium again, but all the symptoms came back."
,Obama/socialism is the wrong direction
,Lilly's going to be in trouble for this one - it should be yanked off the shelf.
,All in all though Cymbalta is the right drug for me and really saved my life.
,"If you take this for an extended amount of time, it actually stops your body from absorbing vital nutrients such as b12 and magnesium and potassium."
,"And even though I found it effective, I agree that it is horrid to wean off of it."
,I can't stand to sleep any more.
,It wasn't.
,I can't sleep more than a few hours before waking up and I'm having nightmares.
,"My doctor wanted me to stay on it, but after reading things here, no way!"
,I would not recommend this medication to anyone.
,Yet I still have sexual urges which makes it even more frustrating when I want to do it and can't enjoy it as much.
,Now that I've stabilized the side effects outweigh any benefits.
,Went back to the doctor and he perscribed Wellbutrin SR ( 150mg ) to take in addition to the Cymbalta to counter the side effect.
,I thought I was losing my mind!!!!
,My doctor started me on this drug at a 60mg dose.
,The happy feeling all the time was great but now after all these years  of working to loose a job and damage you mariage is not worth it.
,"I think I will stop taking Cymbalta, as it affects my studies at university."
,when i was on cymbalta before i was able to lose weight and not feel hungry all the time.
,40 before breakfast another 40 later on in the day.
,Every time I move too much and the dizziness and brain zaps become too much I want to break down and cry so bad.
,"Now, it is 2 days later."
,"My mood has improved already, to early to tell on the dysautonomia (or re-balancing of the autonomic nervous system)I have been experiencing neurocardiogenic syncope for years which did not stop fully with a pacemaker and cardiac meds so we are trying cymbalta."
,My Psychiatrist one time put me on Buspar when I was going through a difficult divorce.
,"Also, I also just seem mostly numb which is pretty scary."
,I gotta say this...
,I WOULD TAKE 2O ANXIETY ATTAKS RAATHER THAN GO THREW THIS WITHDRAWL AGAIN
,"I can live with a little gas as long as the heartburn is gone, though my cohorts at work might disagree ;|"
,I'm starting to get interested in my life again...
,I swear within 2 days of taking Nexium I could tell 100% difference and within a couple of weeks I forgot I had any kind of heartburn or acid reflux at all.
,"My sweats stopped, but my back and neck pain came back with a bang, and my depression set back in along with the raging/anger and a feeling of being totally out of control from the Wellbutrin."
,I blamed most of my side effects on my age although I couldn't understand why friends my age didn't seem to be having these difficulties.
,Cymbalta worked well for my joint pain but getting depression was worrisome.
,"I was hospitalized with what I call an ""anger stimulated adrenaline rush."""
,I knew this anxiety was something different but would have never thought it was due to the medication.
,I took one 30 mg dose in the a.m. on way work because I had read that it could keep you awake at night.
,i almost NEVER take a tums now!
,Has anyone else had this problem?
,Now I don't wake up until morning but I am soaked with sweat.
,"If I miss a day, i am so sick and nauseaus."
,Then horrific insomnia hit at 60mg.
,"I was only on it maybe 6 -8 weeks and cannot say whether it would help long-term with vuvlodynia, but it did not combine well with Trazodone which I had to go off (sleep inducing, for FMS) - I switched to Lyrica for the vulvodynia and it is much easier to go on, plus it helps me sleep without the trazodone."
,OTC version was too expensive.
,Last day I am taking this medication.
,"And, you cann"
,My doc recommended taking for a year.
,"I have read good and bad, and pray that I am one of the good."
,The next day I took pill #2.
,Started back on protonix but did not help.
,Since then I've started dieting and exercising which I'd never cared to do before - resulting in weight loss of 10 lbs so far.
,I'm slowly gaining back weight I struggled very hard to lose and its driving me even more down in the dumps.
,"I've been taking this for about two weeks now, and so far so good."
,I would NOT recommend taking an opiate with Cymbalta; I took Darvocet and it quickly got less effective so I took more and more often-got addicted-NOT good!
,"I was apparently lucky, i quit cold turkey about 9 months ago and didn't have the horrible withdrawals people seem to, then again i already felt so horrible i just may not have noticed."
,"I got a nose bleed upon waking up and getting out of bed the very first day I took Cymbalta, which scared me because it started bleeding just out of nowhere."
,This almost smacks of a class action lawsuit against Lilly for their poisoning us.
,"Cognitively better, sleeping too much can be a problem."
,Make sure to taper down over a 2-3 months period and have Xanax handy.
,This nagging lump feeling in my throat is pretty much gone as well as the chest pain so this makes it really difficult to decide whether or not to continue taking it and just learn to tolerate the side effects.
,I was not aware of the dangers of taking it for too long - I remember my pharmacist mentioning that some people are on this drug long term.
,"Cymbalta, which is an SNRI, seems to help me better than the SSRI's like Prozac, Zoloft, and Paxil."
,Seeing a new doctor who put me on a mood stabilizer and is hopeful I will be able to return to the Cymbalta soon.
,Might report back in a couple of weeks on my progress.
,Hospital doctor asked if I was on any meds.
,I started on 30mg and then increased to 60mg.
,"Cymbalta has helped me to maintain my employment,friendships and go through life without pain and anxiety."
,I ordered it in generic form and took 1 nexium and that night.
,I stopped the oil and continued with Nexium and was very happy for a month or two.
,"Given the nature of the comments on this site, it seems prudent for him to consult his G.P."
,Confused.
,Cymbalta has improved my life in so many ways...I used to be an emotional wreck at work but now...I can handle massive amounts of stress.
,"Look it up, almost every school shooter was on them."
,The benefits by no means outweigh the side effects.
,I had previously used Prozac and Wellbutrin.
,I would not reccomend due to side effects.
,Very sneaky bastard!
,"I didnt think I would ever be normal again, but after about a month it finally let up and I started to feel normal again (depressed still but at least no brain freezes) i am not on wellbutrin and tolerate that just fine, cymbalta to me is junk"
,I still have stomach pains - but I take Mylanta.
,BEWARE!
,My body feels better and I can actually move around and do things.
,"I was also afraid to take them on an empty stomach, so usually took them with food around 4pm (my wife and I are both full time students and we eat that meal before classes every day)."
,But then the side effects really showed up.
,I hope the withdrawals do not destroy my marriage or my job.
,I would have one glass of wine and feel like I drank the whole bottle.
,It feals like I am being compressed from both sides.
,i was started on 60mg 2 weeks ago.
,I am going to stop taking it after 7 days.
,"I am debating what to do, the described side effects are becoming worse and I don't know if cymbalta is ruining my brain function."
,I am happy to say that I have been able to continue working since that time.
,how long did it take for you to feel better?
,"In retrospect and after reading other peoples experiences, every time I have missed a dose or 2, I have started to feel better."
,It's really the only one that has worked for me.
,The brain zaps were weird.
,it needs to be taken off the market.
,I am playing with my kids and smiling and laughing everyone can tell.
,"The social anxiety is still there, but honestly unless you want to be a drugged up zombie who has no emotions I would reccommend counciling and learning how to relax when with people or in public."
,Please don't take this medicine.
,I could not get out of bed.
,Thank you so much for this site.
,The industry needs more honesty about Cymbalta side effects-it made my liffe a livng hell for 2 years.
,Then it hit.
,Still can't leave the house.
,"The first time I tried it, I got very nauseated and stopped taking it, but decided months later to take it with food and didn't have that problem again."
,I'm taking Zoloft now which is really helping to get me off Cymbalta.
,Buring sensations on side of the face and ear.
,why does a M.D.
,DO NOT TAKE MY ADVICE LIGHTLY.
,"The only major side effect for me has been delayed orgasm, Libido went back to normal after remission, but reaching orgasm during sex is really hard, which wasn't the case before."
,I feel worse than I ever have in my life!
,"I feel sorry for those who aren't so lucky, as I would be without a job and friends thanks to this."
,Had a few brain zaps cutting down to 30 mg's but not too bad.
,Stick with the drug and ride out the initial insomnia.
,I am only on 30 mgs.
,"I experienced severe GI, digestive, upper stomach pain for 3 months after initiating Elavil (amitryptline for only 5 days)."
,I feel no depression.
,Was so thrilled.
,You have to take them every 4 hours.
,I have not felt dizzy even with exertion and exercise and my blood pressure has remained normal .
,AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
,I was having severe anxiety and a lot of sleepless nights.
,"I just refilled my next 3 month prescription, but won't be taking it."
,Thanking you for any input.
,"That is their doctor's fault, not the drug."
,"I hate the idea of how this drug is ""thought to work"", not knowing how this medication works or even long term effects."
,"Deep depression, I would get from time to time."
,"Treats the GERD really well, and unfortunately, mine is really bad without medication."
,"I am actually bipolar with psychosis and I dont want to take moodstabilasers, because I cant read when taking them."
,"I started to feel better- I didn't sleep much but felt more ""alert"" and awake initially."
,"I was so sick the 3rd day off of it, felt like I had the flu."
,This medicine has been a life saver to me.
,restless in late night and only really got to sleep at 3pm.
,"It has gotten better but not gone completely - - it is either withdrawal from cymbalta (timing is right) or a later allergic reaction to Celebrex, which I have stopped taking also."
,I am a full time graduate student who works full time.
,"I wrote about 10 months ago, talking about how awful I felt while taking Nexium."
,I am going to see my doctor this week and ask her to take me off both these drugs.
,"Since this is a relatively new drug, not enough research has been conducted, nor is there evidence of it's long term effects."
,finally a solution came.
,I only took it once and I felt really awful.
,First off anyone who posts here should wait at least a month as to really get the effects of this med.
,"Been off nexium for 10 days, feeling better but still have lingering symptoms such as rapid heartbeat and dizziness."
,the mood swings were horrible
,It's not easy.
,"Be on the look out for any strange changes in behavior and never, never, take it personally if your doctor or any of your loved ones confront you with your changed demeanor."
,I have only been on it for a week and a half and I can't take it anymore.
,The dizziness continued for about 3 months and eventually I began to suspect that it may be Nexium causing the dizziness and discontinued use.
,I was on 60 mg for 6 months.
,Mixing certain foods always cause acid reflux and gas.
,Doc won't respond to my phonecalls about this development.
,Don&#
,I plan to call the prescribing doctor as soon as possible and see if this can be resolved.
,I was still very depressed and was increased to 120mgs.2 years ago.
,Hot flashes b/c of high blood pressure are still a bother.

,"I have only been on this medication 8 days, I slept good the first two-three nights that I took it, but the next 2 nights, I would wake up, go to turn over and would just shake  uncontrollably."
,It is scary to think doctors do NOT always do their homework or really look at a paitents meds!

,i can cry and have regular emotions though.
,About a week ago I read something on side affects for Cymbalta and discontinued it.
,Not for me.
,"If they do, I'd rather switch than deal with the nausea and chills."
,I held off for several months because of experiences like many mentioned here.

,I had high blood pressure and migraines so Inderal was added.
,"Don't wait around, and get a Dr's opinion."
,This is the strangest drug i have ever taken.
,Side effects have been less severe with Cymbalta than the other drugs.
,My family has noticed a big difference in me which is always a plus :)
,The combination of the Cymbalta and Xanax helps me be more relaxed and productive at work and at home.
,then you can open it and remove some beads.
,The headaches increased in intensity over several days.
,"I discontinued the nexium and still have some of the side effects, but each is gradually waning."
,Nexium has been a life saver.
,There it was rash & itching on the sex parts.

,"HE IMMEDIATELY STARTED HAVING PAINFUL GAS, BLOATING, BELCHING."
,(There's a 20mg but evidently that's not the standard sample handed out).

,it has helped rid me of anxiety and the depression is slowly fading away.
,once per week maybe.
,Please do not take this drug!
,I have been taking Cymbalta for  almost four and a  half years.
,It figures that I would finally find a medication that works for me but makes me fart and constantly feel like I need to throw-up.
,Currently take 30mg 3 times a week down from 60mg daily.
,I will go back to Nexium.
,"I realize if I had hot flush, I just need to sweat it out by doing some excerise."

,"I think this is an all right medicine for some folks, the jury is still out for me."
,"Last week, however, I noticed my hairline receding and general thinness in my hair."
,It's too early to tell I have only been on it for one week at 30 mg's along with 37.5 & 75 Effexor.
,Glad I found this site explains why I cant sleep.
,Couldn't find any feedback in Belgium (where I live) and thought I was going crazy.

,I need something to help me forget.
,After years of a good and active sex life this was not acceptable.
,I do have a sunnier outlook though.
,I have an appointment next month at Temple U in Piladelphia and will discuss nissen fundoplycation surgery.
,But the withdrawal symptoms I've read about are unsettling and it makes me wonder what this drug really does to your body in the long term.
,"Traded the dreaded Effexor for alleged wonder drug, Cymbalta."
,"I had also noticed that it took more to hold my attention than it used to, and I couldn't remember things that happened or stuff people said five minutes before."
,"Could hear noises in my stomach, almost like a tablet was effervescing inside my stomach."
,See if your Doc knows the details of this drug before you take it.
,There are some who suffer mild side effects but there are more who suffer more.
,I guess it goes to show it's all about your own body chemistry.
,I would use caution when using this drug or even when your doctor recommends it.
,I've had fantastic results.
,NEVER TAKE THIS POISON.
,it was terrible.
,My dr suggested Cymbalta.
True,I wonder if its a common side effect of Anxiety drugs?
,it increased my anxiety and did nothing for my depression but i became so apathetic i didn't even care how horrible my life had become.
,cymbalta day by day let me know what is really GAD.
,without the typical crash and burn affects.
,Virtually lost it when increasing the daily dose from 30 to 60mg daily - stayed there for 1 week then dropped back.
,"I am confused, off balance sufferes from asphasia (severly was hospitalized) and was asked to take dissability from work for appearing ""stoned."""
,I had been on paxil and celexa previously and never had withdrawal side effects.

,I'm glad I hung in there; it's a life saver.
,"I had a few odd aches and pains about a month into the Cymbalta, and a little sleeping difficulty."
,"although i do have the desire and can achieve an erection, it is difficult for me to orgasm."
,It works so well for my Depression and Panic disorder and Neuropathy pain.
,I also cannot deal with the sweating.
,I assumed that it was a benign drug and never made the connection between the Nexium and the myriad of health problems I had been having.
,The side effects are too much to take.
,"Switched to Cymbalta from Effexor XR & now I have energy, spirit, and just feel GOOD."
,"After taking this drug for over one year, it continues to be extremely helpful for both chronic pain and minor depression."
,"Some are so ridiculous, one person saying they had a fever and muscle ache, really?"
,"Now, the bad:  I got a bad stomach ache the first day but it didn't happen after the second day."
,Why does something that supposed to help you have so many faults?
,I just want to feel more balanced and not so emotionally raw.
,After some messed up dreams and about 12 hours later I am up and excited about the 12 things I plan to do (badly) at once.
,"I do not feel ""zombie-like"" or tired, in fact I feel like I have more  clarity and energy."
,This is a horrible product with a very sinister possiblity for a life threatening reaction that swells your throat shut.

,www.nexium-vs-joints.com
,All I know it stop the Acid pain even on a bland diet.
,I could barely move or get out of bed.
,I should have been weaned off.
,I may try to lessen the dose or consider going off of it because I'd like to have more energy.
,The dose was increased to 60mg and it started to work for the chronic pain ( spinal stenosis from 2 back surgeries and hip replacement).
,I would say 95% positive benefits vs. 5% negative side effects.
,Starting taking Nexium about 3 years ago.
,I've only been on it for a couple of days and know already that I won't continue.
,"This is a BAD drug, they should have better warnings about the side effects."

,I have been on about 7 different antidepressants.
,Don't take it!!
,I look forward to each step where scientists take one further towards a better life for those who suffer.
,"Started at 30 mg's, then went up to 60 mg's, but just cut back down to 30 mg's because felt that it was making me feel like a zombie during the day even though I take my pill before bed."
,I felt like I had strep throat all the time.
,I am not afraid of pain by the way I have haf 10 children.

,I have come off of Cymbalta after a year of weaning.
,I seriously thought something was really wrong with me and not sure what to do.

,I've been feeling totally crappy ever since a few days after I started taking the Nexium.

,"I have been off it about 10 days and, I may not have loss weight, but the skin reddening is going away."
,"Actually worked okay for the first 9 months (hey, doctors don't have a clue how all these drugs work but they dole them out to millions of us guinea pigs every day) , then everything turned bad: I became so depressed that I wrote my goodbye letters and picked out a spot to park my car where I wouldn't be disturbed once I stuck the hose from the exhaust into the window; I had trouble concentrating on driving and had a rear-end collision; having never been a great sleeper, I began waking up 30-50 times per night so I was constantly exhausted; lost the little that was left of my libido; experienced extreme pain in my muscles and joints..."

,Then I read all these stories about the anxiety that other people were having just like me.
,I'm hoping I found the answer to my dilemma.
,I had a terrible anxiety attack 2 summers ago in the car as a passenger.
,My doctor said that the side effects will get better.
,It has definitely helped with the frequency and severity of my migraines
,"I didn't realize unti I typed in nexium and leg pain that the Nexium was causing the severe pain in my hips, legs bones etc."
,I hate CYMBALTA.
,Reduced it to once a day and heartburn worse.
,Would not recommend this medication to anybody!
,Before Cymbalta I was on Effexor which took several months to wean myself off of once all the aches and pains were under control.
,READ the side effects and the withdrawal symptoms.
,"Maybe something else would have done a better job with fewer side-effects, but I doubt it."
,I could do this for a couple of days and then on the 3rd day I would get really nauseated and vomit.
,I'm a high-anxiety kind of person by nature and this drug has really allowed me to relax and enjoy my life a lot more.
,I am going to try DGL to calm stomach.
,"Additionally, I am afraid of the withdrawal effects after long term use."
,But I do remember in the beginning not feeling so great.
,Had to switch to Nexium due to the military no longer providing Aciphex.
,Then came Nexium!
False,I came close to killing myself 3 times while on it or coming off it.
,"if i move wrong my body ""zaps""."
,Had no difficulty with going off cymbalta.
,I took Nexium from Aug. 06 to Jan 07 and the symptoms got worse so I stopped the meds.
,"Cymbalta works, but at what cost?"
,I am happy I laugh and smile.
,"I feel great, I'm able to work 2 jobs + able to be a better father and husband."
,is better than Lexapro - which I was on for 2 years (20 mg.)
,"If you want to email me for more in fo, please do."
,Nexium.
,"Even thought it initially halted my FM pain,"
,Either too much or too little.
,"I don't have the headaches anymore, the dreaming has normalized, the dry mouth and dry eyes has gone away."
,Also a suppliment called heartburn ease.
,I immediately got out of the shower and sat down on the floor.
,I've taken several different antidepressants and none had worked so good so fast.
,Cymbalta is helping me.
,I have degenerative disk disease and am pretty used to living with a dull backache.
,Today I felt really good until about 5.00pm and now the anxiety is back.
,What I did to wean off the drug is I started out with every other day for 1 month.
,Within 24 hrs my symptoms were getting better.
,I have been on it now for five weeks and feel great.
,Its horrible.
,i love it.
,"Apart from the tiredness, I'm actually happier and I've had less anxiety, which is great."
,Cymbalta is saving my life.
,"been having grds for over 6 years,used to eat tums like crazy also tried prilosec that was effective but too many side effects finally went to see a doc about a year ago and she prescribed nexium, i went from taking 1 a day to 1 a week in less than 2 months."
,"If I missed a day, the brain zaps were almost debilitating."
,There was some constipation but I did go.
,"I don't see any correlation to this med and diarrea and I am not worried about the effects of ""going off it"" as I plan to ""stay on it"" as long as I feel this good."
,"And when I say that, I mean that I wake up with my sheets completely soaked, my hair is soaking wet, my clothes are completely wet, etc."
,Became depressed from dealing with daily pain of fibromyalgia and realized I needed help.
,I have to say I would put up with side effects if I knew this is what would eliminate any cancers.
,I cry for no reason.
,"it is very useful in depression, attention and especially in GAD too."
,THANK GOD this website is here because I thought I was either going to have a heart attack or I was going insane!
,My doctor suggested taking it at nite to subdue any feeling of tiredness.
,THIS MEDICATION.
,Once the withdrawals subsided which took about 3 weeks I felt much better.
,I felt better than I had felt in years.
,I am working with my doctor on how to address these problems.
,I'm praying that my brain returns to normal and this stops.
,I have had acid reflux for 20 years and have been taking Acid which helped very much.
,What depression I had has reduced alot.
,"I feel like a total zombie, can't do much but get in and out of bed to go to the bathroom."
,I hope to be able to keep taking this med.
,Exausted too!
,I had my first experience with anxiety and a full blown panic attack in Jan. of this year.
True,I have depression resulting from extreme pain.
,I've never been on an antidepressant.
,Nexium has been working fine for me with no side effects but if you suffer from side effects speak to your doctor.
,Immediately after I took the first dose I noticed that this is a STRONG drug.
,4 days was not enough to see any pain moderation and no drug is worth being giving up life and being confined to bed.
,"In just the past year and a half, t times I have been forced to cut back to point of not having any medications for a month or two and then to go back on' it has been a nightmare, got to point of losing weight, not being able to eat, insomina, worsened depression, panic attacks and agoraphobia just to name a few."
,"I would encourage you to speak to your doctor right away if some of those really bad side effects occur - this drug is so new, there's no long term studies on it, so we don't know how it reacts with different symptoms, different physiology."
,i'd rather have to go through anxiety attacks than feel like an emotionless zombie all day.
,I am naturally very thin and this part is driving me crazy!!
,"So far this is a ""yes"" for me."
,Anxiety has dissapated greatly and less attacks.
,"Helped the reflux, but not worth the toll it's taken on my body."
,I had similar effects with Paxil-  5 months to wean off.
,"My fatigue and down time is still present, no suicide thoughts but just NO enjoyment in anything."
,I have never felt more out of my head then on this medicene!
,Started on 60mg.
,"I wasn't irritated all the time, very calm, almost oo calm like i didn't care about anything."
,doc prescribed 40mg twice a day.
,"But, I started noticing problems with my digestion."
,i've been on it again now for 3 days and i can say that the worst part of this drug is coming off of it or going onto it.
,It took me about a month for the terrible side effects of Nexium to go away.
,I don't know the proper way of coming off this drug it appears from all the post there is none.
,I have anxiety and depression and have been on and off of Cymbalta.
,"I could not sleep, and really just became more stressed than before I was taking it."
,I cannot emphasize what a side-effect improvement adding the welbutrin was!
,"They work better than Pantoprazole, which gave me a severe fatigue and dark coloured urine and back pain."
,I rather be depressed and in shape rather than fat and nuts.
,"Anyway, Dr prescribed Lyrica which is rather new for depression, and although it slowly helped, I developed a rash from it even at a low dose."
,"Withdrawal difficulty very real even after 4 days: shakes, disorientation, nausea, blurred vision."
,I wish I had found this site earlier.
,Does it cause loss of REM sleep in all patients?
,"  However, recent blood tests are showing a very serious drop in red cell platelets and my doctor has no solution other than to assume it is due to one of the  3 meds I'm taking, with Nexium being the prime suspect."

,"When I startedon Cymbalta, I got heart burn for 3-4 days, and then nothing up until a week ago and now severe heart burn."
,"Caution: I recommend to everyone that when starting a new medication – Start Slow; increase slowly over a long period of time; and when it comes time to decrease or discontinue,  Decrease slowly over a long period of time."
,Fantastic.
,Cymbalta frightens me and I strongly urge anyone considering this drug to do their homework carefully.
,"However, it gradually suppresses the 3rd, 4th, and 5th levels of sleep."
,I got a 2 weeks supply from my DR and I am gonna take it the whole 2 weeks and see if there is improvement.
,I am taking a probiotic which is helping my digestive system.
,I want to sleep all day.
,the only thing that cured my refulx.
,Been off nexium one week andneed to find a acid reflux alternative other than this deadly nexium.
,I think everyone's body is different.

,What a nightmare.
,"I am 5""6"" and weigh 130 lbs so I am not a big person."
,Waking in the middle of the night and not being able to go back to sleep was big problem.
,I'm keeping my fingers crossed that this stuff doesn't do to me what Nexium did!!!

,"This med I can take in the morning or early afternoon, without any kind of fatigue."
,"my first day taking it I had the worst anxiety of my life, very real haluctinations....after seeing my doctor a week later she told me I should continue to take cymbalta that the side effects would lessen but they didnt, they got worse."
,It is worth the side effects to me.
,No loss of libido.

,I never want to be without this drug.
,I am currently on 90 due to my insurance having limits on how many pills they will allow.
,I think Neurontin might be better.
,"I am just not used to not being on an emotional rollercoaster, make sense?"
,Getting off of this medication was truly miserable.
,WITHIN 4 DAYS IT STARTING WORKING.
,"I am VERY against suicide, not depressed, and had NO REASON to feel that way so I quickly realized the culprit was Cymbalta."
,"Recently, on my quest to find a solution I went to a neurologist  who diagnosed me w/ ""small fiber painful peripheral neuropathology.” Anyway, the doctor thought I might benefit from Cymbalta and he gave me a free 3 week course."

,But side effects are not worth it.
,I have missed the occasional dose with absolutely no problems.
,"I dont think I'll ever find something that makes me feel content and happy and help me stop worrying so much, without the sleepy zombie feeling..."

,It was quite frightening.
,I took it for 5 days: the first 3 days I felt okay but day 4 and 5 were dreadful; I feel and fear as if I'm suffering from a terminal disease.
,my anxiety goes away for hours and then returns with a vengeance

,Was prescribed it for h. pylori.
,"Although the side effects are severe with me, it was still a hard decision to come off Nexium as I was in so much pain beforehand."
,"I have come off again with help of Wellbutrin, I hope it works, withdrawel is awful."
,Please do not take Nexium.

,I had barely slept and had lost over 6 pounds within the first week because just the thought of food would make me sick to my stomach.

,"It worked for about a month.then i felt it quit working went up to 60 mg. 60mg makes me sleepy so, I take my dose before bed and the next day things are great!"
,Mood is great.
,Stopped this drug b/c it wasn't really working and left me emotionally flat.
,I am a different person.
,If people educated themselves on what they were likely to expect and didn't freak out after one day of sweating I am sure a few more people would benefit.
,"Please everyone, let serotonin drugs be a last resort, it's probably going to be mine, because I really don't know if I am going to make it!"
,been six days so far.
,"Nothing works, but at least they didn't drive me insane like CYMBALTA."
,I think it is the worst thing I have ever taken - for almost a year I have tried to take it hinking it would help or blaming my body for the effects and now I have come to realise it is this drug / poison.
,"Ive tried just about every AD and nothing, NOTHING is like this to come off of."
,Seems like every pill you take for one illness creates an entirely new set of ills.
,I am very pleased with that med combination.
,I went off of it cold turkey and began to feel sane the very next day.
,"I'm still on Lithium which is doing alright, and still on Xanax which seems to be the only thing I can outright handle without any side effects."
,It has worked wonders for me.
,I was prescribed this drug for suspected stomach ulcer.
,"And, I take ONLY NEXIUM so there is no doubt Nexium is causing most or all of these side affects."

,I had waited 7 years for a baby.
,I liked that it made me seem emotionally detached events happened that would normally make me burst into tears but with Cymbalta I was emotionally free.I had less headaches I hate that I had a reaction to it and my doctor took me off of it.
,That&#8217;s due to its potency.
,I weaned off this med after taking it for 6 years because I felt my life situation was better and I didn't need it anymore.
,I was taing 60mg for 6 weeks and abruptly stopped it.
,Zoloft was awful and gave me screaming nightmares but this is just horrendous.
,I have been in withdrawl for almost two months with no end in sight.
,This is my first day off of Nexium.
,"I am rather surprised at the dramatic side effects reported on this site as a result of nexium,I would rather take nexium on and off than risk ending up with barrets.I had no side effects,certainly no depression except for that caused by being unable to eat and drink as freely as others,I was concerned at being on this drug for so long considering the usual length of time seems to be 4 to 6 weeks,during the year I was on Nexium I suffered from NO heartburn whatsoever,I have been off the drug now for just over a week and the heartburn has returned and this is despite having my bed raised,avoiding large meals,not smoking or being over weight and not eating up to 4 hours before bedtime,the reflux isn't severe now but it is a daily occurance and is in itself depressing.Nexium gave me relief from symptoms for a year and I am glad of that."
,"By the 3rd day, I couldnt get off my couch and the anxiety and panic attacks were non stop!!"
,"Approximately 1 week into taking the Nexium, he had his first dizzy spell and fainted."

,It worked great for the fibro pain but I quit after 10 tens because of all the side effects.
,Now those two things have been very effective.
,"I talked to my doctor about it, and she told me to take it once a day instead of twice."
,I was on this for about a year and didn't notice the effects until about 6 months in.
,My car accident was seven months ago and I feel really good!
,I also had no urge to read my mail or walk to basement to do laundry.
,I am only suppose to take Nexium for a week to see if the symptom has got better.
,I've read all the negative and positive.
,It was wonderful with my worst pain and depression.
,Doc gave me some samples of Cymbalta to try.
,I can't live like this!
,I tried many anti-depressants.
,I will take as long as needed and do not fear stopping.
,Going back to Lexapro immediately.
,"I am NOT a doctor, so please ignore me if you think I am incorrect."
,My ears are ringing and i get up and stumbles around in panic.

,I do not like most medicines and try to avoid them but my doctors keep telling me I need them.
,I feel wonderful in the mornings now and can immediately get up and start my day without the fog.
,Additionally I got Remeron to sleep.
,I think I was retaining water because my clothes seem to fit better now that I am off the med.
,"Once, I forgot to take it in the morning and the heartburn/reflux returned, so it does work..now I have stopped taking it for 2 days now because of all the side effects I've been reading about, but I have to be careful of what I eat and drink."
,I still have some of the 2nd prec.

,I am convinced it was caused by this drug.
,"I've taken Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Lexapro, Lamictal, and Adderall."
,Can't get over how much better I feel now off of this drug.
,"TRIED TAKING EFFEXOR, BUSPAR, ZOLOFT, TRAZADONE, XANAX AND NONE OF THEM WORKED UNTIL I STARTED TAKING CYBALTA."
,"So for now, my three days of tapering down is on hold."
,I choose to stay on Cymbalta because of it's wonderful help with my joint pain.
,I am coming off it now and already see a difference.
,I was pretty satisfied with its effectiveness and side effect profile.
,I discontinued Nexium but still have pain 2 weeks afterwards.
,"For the first two weeks I felt very spacey and drugged, a feeling similar to taking extasy."
,Fortunately I found a Dr. who understands this.
,Since taking this medicine I have had one symptom after another.
,I have ate 90mg before and went down to 30 without a problem.
,Doc switched me to yet another one.
,"He was lethargic; he would just say, “I don’t know” like somebody lost."
,OK so far.
,has anyone used protuim/pranspolzole what is this like and what side effects does it have
,"After reading the reviews on this website, I was terrified of taking this medication!"
,I long for the good old days when the anxiety was hardly there and the depression wasn't anywhere near this bad.
,"My memory loss worsened, as did my stutter, attention span, and depression."
,"Cymbalta has definitely removed the ""lack of interest"" or ""negativity and anxiety that was building in me."
,If this is the answer I will call every doctor and pharmacy I can think of and tell them what this has done to my daughter.
,"It does help the headaches, positive, but I feel dull and more lifeless."
,I was already taking Wellbutrin but the depression was the worst I had ever had and doctor added the cymbalta 30 mg a day.
,So I figure in my mind that having one tablet to take and only pay for just one lot of medication ($34.20Aud) has to have a plus and only one set of side effects and withdrawal symptoms to cope with is even more a plus.
,"Over a few weeks, your esophagus *might* start swell up because of the missing minimum acid level, thus creating some problems at organs/veins close to the esophagus."
,"Well, I now feel better than I have in a looooooonnnnnnnngggggg time."
,I don't think it is an anxiety drug though.

,I suppose he will start another SSRI or Effexor ASAP.

,I have only been taking Nexium for a week and a half so I didn't really think it could be causing my symptoms.
,how could they not put these symptoms so the the public can read them?
,I am trying to wean off.
,Can't remember the last time I had any real feelings.
,Formerly athletic & energetic.
,"Including the two month plan, it was still a little over three months before all of the withdrawal symptoms vanished."
,You can cure yourself!
,This poison takes a while before the side effects become debilitating.
,"Anyway, I didn't take a tablet today and I'm feeling much better, we'll see tomorrow."
,I begrudgingly allowed my Rheumatologist prescribe it for Fibro even though I had taken it several years ago and hated it.
,"On Cymbalta, I'm more comfortable in social environments, not as anxious about everything, have more get up and go."
,I am going to stick with it because I would rather have the side effects than deal with being so depressed all of the time.
,It is extremely expensive and I would love to come off my meds but I fear the suicidal thougts/tendencies worse than the withdrawl and side effects from Cymbalta.
,I was sleeping a lot more than usual and slept during the day.
,"It's the only medication out there that helps, and believe me, I've tried them all."
,DO NOT TAKE CYMBALTA--it has the potential to ruin the very essence of who you are.
,"But I do feel better, more energy,feeling hopeful about life for the first time in a long time."
,"Kind of frustrating as sex is one of the good things in life, but I'm going to stick it out and see if this resolves itself."
,"I was told about a Cymbalta trial, so I waited 30 days from the end of the other pills and started the trial."
,"I would say my feelings are slightly muted, but in the normal range."
,Any suggestions?
,it seems to be uneffective to me.
,Worse then withdrawing from narotics like methamphetamines.
,This is my 2nd day.
,"this is my second time being perscribed cymbalta, the first time i stopped taking it ONLY because my insurance no longer covered it."
,I have no insurance and my cymbalta is $185.00 a month.
,I also have a hiatus hernia (I am 25).
,This month I did not even know I was about to start!
,This time with irregular heart beat.
,"I FINALLY feel good again, but was terrified that the med had done some irreparable damage to my brain."
,"Decreased Cymbalta as prescribed, down 30mg each week, from 120mg down to 0."
,I am weening off Cymbalta now.
,If it hadn't been for the herbals I took I don't know where I'd be.
,"Depression makes me unmotivated to do anything at all, even socialize."
,Since starting Cymbalta 7 days ago I have had only 1 severe migraine due to a virus and it lasted only a few hours otherwise I have felt great.
,effects there were.
,Still unsure if it's working.
,"It is not ""poison "" and your totally ignorant to say such a thing, doctors go to school for a lengthy period of time and are doing whats in beat interest for their ppatients, with the exception of some doctors."
,Withdrawal is HELL...it has been almost 2 weeks and the HELL continues.
,I burn things when I cook because I cant stay on task anymore.
,Now taking 100 mg. of Zoloft and feeling so much better.
,I would pay with no insurance.
,I want off of Cymbalta as soon as possible.
,I took 40 mg twice a day for 2 weeks and then went down to once a day for a week.
,headache in the neck wich did become severe(migrane-like?)
,"I have tried others in the past and had gained weight..no libido, etc."
,"i didn't know what feeling ""normal"" was like until i started taking this medication."
,"Only problem, that I quickly adapted to, was the shaking in the hands."
,:-)
,Never experienced anything so difficult in my life.
,"But now have to really cram calcium, etc to get my bone density (lowest rating on the charts) back up."
,"I still feel dizzy and nauseated, and my hands and feet are tingling."
,this is really hurting my relationship and i cant deal with it much longer.
,I don't really remember much.
,I never would've started.
,I tried prozac & Zoloft nothing happened.
,I FELT THE 30MG DOSE LEVELLING OUT AT A  PLATEAU ABOUT 2 WEEKS AGO.
,"I had one too many side effects with this medication, my stomach ulcer as the endoscopy revealed, was a tiny one less than 5mm, but apparently this was necessary to reduce the acid in my stomach."
,"Unfortunately, every time I have tried weening myself off, I have experienced unbelievable pain from gerd."
,The problem is a hernia keeping the lower spincter open.
,"I'm glad this Rx was & is  helpful to some, but I actually would have quit it long ago if it weren't for the wicked withdrawals."
,becouse of my religion i would not kill myself.
,I took it for a week and it seemed to help.
,"I quit taking the drug for a month and I was feeling great for a couple of weeks, but my IBS is back in a bad way."
,"Still can't sleep, racing thoughts, horrible dizziness/brain zaps, bloating (holding water) heavy sweating."
,I recommend Nexium!!
,"So far I am glad I did , Good luck all."
,Surely there is something that can address these issues without the severe sweating and other major side effects.
,and I have much better days.
,Everyone should have a liver profile before thinking about taking this med.
,"Appears to be doing its job, I feel a lot better."
,so far so good.
,Cymbalta helped my anxiety almost immediately and I am much calmer now.
,The side effect is not worth the benefit for this medicine.
,Now I see it is a common side effect of nexium.
,and gas really effect my self esteem.
,I felt I could never find any peace.
,"Her GI doctor told me ""it can't be from the Nexium."
,So being bloated is very bad news for my emotions.
,Seemed like my body would get used to the med and not work as well.
,I feel the Nexium has masked these until now.
,I am on 30 mg.
,"These drugs both had similar side effects to Cymbalta and hard to withdraw from with bad withdrawal symptoms the only difference is the Endep knocked me out at night and I slept well, only very drousy and tired during the day, sexual disfunction just the same."
,"It got frustrating some days and I felt like I couldn't do it, but each week and month got easier."
,Been on Proton Pump Inhibitors for 10 years.
,"In addition, I would be extremely light sensitive and dizzy."
,"I cant get any reading done, im so bombed."
,Cymbalta is nowhere near as bad.

,I feel great!
,"Also, felt very foggy and unmotivated."
,"I haven't felt many side effects, so I'm giving it a while."
,I have been taking Cymbalta (60 mg once a day) since late December 2007.
,Side effects got A LOT worse.
,that was for about a month.
,I'm on 60 mg and have actually never felt better in my life since I'm usually more or less depressed (though with a basically good attitude).
,"Also, I've taken anti-depressants for years, so I'm familiar with the ""brain zaps"" that come with weaning off various medications."
,"when i layed down my mind was racing way more than it ever has (and i already have trouble sleeping but this is weird) and after reading all the withdrawl symptoms, i never want to go through that."
,Cymbalta worked wonders for me for the first 10 months I took it.
,I take 40mg a day in the morning.
,I have read postings where people state they are taking it for mild pain or stress....this strikes me as odd.
,"I also gave up my job last year, retired from 31 years due to side affects that I believe now, are due to the Nexium, and after reading these comments."
,"I am currently still trying to find a more ""mild"" drug to help with my pmdd/anxiety, no luck as of yet"
,It took a long time for my family doctor to figure out that it was the Cymbalta causing the sweating.
,"I feel like my old ""MEGA-MOM"" self again!"
,I think I will be switching back to Paxil very soon.
,The only bad thing I have experienced is if i forget a dose the night before the next day my brain has these weird sparks!
,I've read that 3 out of every 11 patients on PPI drugs will now develop stomach polyps.
,"Very happy about that, am able to function in all areas."
,Now my emotional food urges are almost non-existent.
,"The first time I tried Cymbalta, I thought, this might work even though it made me sleepy; I thought that symptom would go away."

,Good to go for almost 3 months.
,Cardiac ruled out.

,Some People ReportedLy Suffered
,Of course my insurance dropped it because it is so popular now.
,I have been on cymbalta for a few months now.
,Then I found this site-TG!
,"""Discontinuation Syndrome"" is a known problem but the only people that care are the ones experiencing it."
,I think CYMPBALTA has SAVED MY LIFE!!
,with my psyc
,"I""m going to stop taking this and see if the symptoms go away, as I've been tested for every thing under the sun and am supposedly ""fine""."
,I can say nothing bad about the drug as long as it it TAKEN PROPERLY.
,I would recommend this drug to anyone suffering from GERD as I was .
,I don't know how I ever lived without this drug - it's amazing!
,The Dr. gave me nexium.

,I'm finally loving life again and can cope with the chronic pain that I used to have.
,"Today is my first day not taking it and I have not felt the throat tightness, rib aches or muscle aches."
,"I was previously taking Lexapro for my depression, which wasn't helping at all."
,"I was on 60 mg of Cymbalta for 1 month; after I talked to my doctor about the side effects and my unhappiness re same, we agreed to reduce my dosage to 30 mgs daily to see if any improvements might occur."
,"I was somewhat hyper/ talkative the first week (a major shift from being extremely quiet, removed, and antisocial), but that was mostly with family members."
,"I tried several anti depressents with my family doctor and my therapist, and all make me feel brain dead."
,"I bet it will be taken off the market soon, if no"

,"The lowest dose is not strong enough to help depression, but that wasn't my problem."
,"I feel so much better on it, happier, able to do activities I'd given up on."
,It also kept my mood much more stable.
,By May 7th they were at their worst.
,It's working for me and I feel less depressed than while on the antidepressant Cymbalta.
,"I have stopped taking the Nexium, and have not had the anxiety since."
,Opened up my capsules and took out half so I assumed I was going from 60mgs to 30 mgs.
,NO.
,I actually forbid my mother from taking the drug (she is mentally unstable) and went so far as to call her doctor myself.
,In response to the person who is having trouble getting Bluecross to pay for the drug - I have Blue Cross/Blue Shield PPO administered by PersCare in California.
,Definately reduces fibro pain.
,The doctor suggested upping it to 90 mg a day but I was scared to try that after reading this site.
,I then commenced 30mg Cymbalta for two weeks and then increased to 60mg for three weeks.
,I can now sit and focus on what family and friends are saying.
,I'm still waiting to feel results and so far I can only say that I'm happy to be at this point.

,"Not too bad now, but it hasn't really lessened my depression or anxiety yet...just switched by my dr. to 60 mg per day plus added Lexapro, & gabapentin for pain & anxiety...the side effects went away after a short time, but now I'm waiting to see if the upped dose & added meds will help...also going to counseling...when I gradually took myself off Cymbalta earlier, I felt like I was flirting with the flu for a few weeks, but it went away."

,Getting off of Cymbalta has been very difficult.

,I became suicidal and I overdosed.
,Try all possible measures to avoid this medication.
,"There is a balance...there are many who are taking this medication and have not had any side effects at all and even the ones that have, it has been worth the side effects."
,HOWEVER Im only on my 3rd day and have done some sleep walking and eating in my sleep.

,I wasn't having a heart attack/failure and the doctors were a bit stumped.
,I can say that this medicine really works effectivly and fast.

,Some of the comments on here are silly and make people uptight.
,"Might try going off completely, wait, then go back on just at 30."
,"My doc added Wellbutrin, 300 mg to see if that would help more."
,My neurologist prescribed this for my neuropathy in my feet after I tried various other drugs and none of them helped.

,"Didn't mind the weight loss, but the urinary retention and bladder and back pain were very uncomfortable."
,I stopped taking Cymbalta cold turkey.
,Did nothing to help ANY of my symptoms
,Long term deterioration of Job opportunities and work challenges caused and increase in my anxiety/depression.

,I wasn't as depressed but at what cost?
,"Although Cymbalta began to reduce my depressive symptoms within the first two or three days I started taking it, and it has been more effective in that respect than any other antidepressant I've taken (including Trazodone, Prozac, Zoloft, and Wellbutrin XL), I don't think I'll continue taking it."
,"I was severely depressed, tried every type of anti depressent on the market, as well as mood stabilizers with anti-depressents."

,"Therefore, I am happy with Cymbalta benefits and will continue to use it to bridge me through this phase and not intending to stay on it for too long."
,"When I got off Nexium it took about a month and a half to start feeling good again, all side effects gone except for spine and shoulder pain but getting better."
,I also got a knife out and put it against my wrist.
,This site gave my my life back.
,Maybe it's a way to offset any perceived placebo effect.
,"i am supposed to double my dosage next week but am scared to at this point because of the side effects - doc wants me to stay on for a month (2 wks @ 20 mg, 2 wks @ 40)."

,My doctor has me on 30mg for one week and then 60mg from there on.
,I'm very happy.
,The key is to step down REALLY slow.
,"worst headaches of my life, heart palpitations, tingling sensation all over my body, hand tremor, blurred vision... i stopped taking it several weeks ago but some of the side effects are still present."
,The only thing this drug helped me with was road rage and aggitation towards coworkers.
,I went to my GP with these complaints and she talked me into staying on it.
,The feeling is horrible from this drug.
,I would like to see the clinical trials for this med.
,I don't get mad as easily as I did at my kids.
,My Dr. wanted me to try this drug rather than using chronic vicodin and I agreed because I respect his opinion.
,"Dropped back to 30 mg, because of side effects."

,I feel like my anxiousness and annoyance with minor things have gone away in a matter of days but the side effects are not good...any advice?
,"All in all, a miracle drug."
,I can't tolerate any anti-depressant at normal doses.
,Justice for the many victims of this death drug.
,"Three weeks ago I decided to stop taking this med the withdrawel symptoms are horrible, I feel like I have been hit by a train but I have motivation and feeling back."
,and most of it was nightmarish!
,"While taking Cymbalta, Ambien no longer worked for insomnia, had to be switched to Seroquel which helped insomnia but then I was a zombie 24/7."
True,I still have the bad dry mouth that we thought was from the nortriptyline.
,Food seems to take on a persona and calls to me.

,"I got really nauseous the first day...I actually dry heaved...but I have a prescription for Zofran and that seems to really help.I have basically no appetite, but I am ok with that as my depression caused me to gain 50 lbs which I am trying to lose."
,Attempted to start the dosage again and within 2 days I was having the same symptoms again.
,I am a little concerned about the weight gain but it may be due to the discontinuance of the Concerta.
,was satisfied with med for the pain but very very dissatisfied that it caused such a side effect that my kids were at risk cause durin an episode there was no way anyone could have gotten me awake enough to be of any good.
,It did not relieve the depression.
,I started having thoughts of killing myself whenever I saw a knife or pair of sissors...then my friends and family brought to my attention that I was drinking alcohol non stop for over a month....priar to taking this medication I had never been a big drinker.

,"I believe that all drugs in the PPI class are poison, at least for some people."

,"That's when the good part came, you have to initially take this medication in a very subscribed manner to get on it as well as off it."
,Cymbalta gave me the worst side effects I've ever expereienced.
,I am getting much better as the days go on now.
,Decrease in anxiety and obsessive worrying.
,I don't know if all this is related to Nexium but my legs and arms felt fine before I started taking it.
,"I just want to put this out there for all the people taking this drug, it does not work miracles after the first day you take it, your body has to get use to the drug."
,They need to make smaller doses!
,"My physician smiled and told me to give it a try; at the very least, he said, it would help curb my anxiety and reduce the incidence of my panic attacks, something I've dealth with, unmedicated, since I was 8 years old."
,I don't know what to do and am trying so hard to be 'normal' - whatever that means!!
,I did experience a couple of awful nightmares and hallucination in the beginning and cut back the dose from 30 mg to about 23 mg.

,Depression has subsided but not totally gone.
,If you have never experienced hell try to stop using this stuff.
,Cymbalta is the only antidepressant medication that ever helped me.
,Dr didn't feel that the articles on the pnemonia were proven.
,What a major weight lifted!!!
,"I was not depressed before taking it, but now I feel down all the time and unmotivated."
,"Day 2 of using it: mood swings, seems to magnify emotions either way, not the best for me."
,"There are specific steps to be followed and it is important to follow them, otherwise Cymbalta withdrawal is quite unpleasant."
,"We got rid of the cats, the dog, the birds (all found good homes), cleaned house constantly, still took copious amounts of allergy medications and eye drops."
,"I went back on and started having very vivid dreams, hot flashes, and drenching night sweats."
,"Nexium works by shutting everything down a little bit in the digestive system, naturally shutting down acid production and getting so-called ""relief."""
,For those of you  for whom cymbalta has been a god send; more power to you.

,"Both my therapist & psychiatrist are extremely puzzled by the instense sweating, as though they're hearing of this side effect for the first time."
,"I always had the skin rashes during my time taking Nexium, I went to the doctor and got medication, thought it was fungal infections that would not clear up."
,I always assumed they were to do with something else but it seems highly probable that they are to do with Nexium.
,I have had CT scans and xrays.
,"My mood has improved, I feel good- relaxed, even tempered and am not dwelling on things like usually, and today my back pain is improved, I feel less nautious when I take in the AM with food."
,I have been on Cymbalta since Febuary 2009 and I love it...

,"My doctor is usually caring and attentive, but simply would not accept that the incredibly rapid weight gain I experienced in the months after I began taking Cymbalta was caused by the drug."
,I am so glad I did.
,Not taking care of this disease might cause stomac cancer in the long run.
,The side-effects are very unpleasant and last for a very long time.
,I put this down to the condition and not the drug... About two months ago I started taking an Ayurvedic capsule called Acibac (more to keep my mom happy who was very concerned about the Nexium).
,I ignored the reviews that I had read about Nexium and decided to try it as my stomach pain had become unbearable.
,I don't really know the extent of my depression or if I'm depressed at all.
,"I will be an emotional WRECK, crying, agitated, abusive, and just plain old crazy."
,Stay away from this drug!
,Give it a try.
,"Also, noted that when trying to talk or ""sing"" my tongue felt very thick and my spouse said that I didn't ""sound"" right."
,"just called in the rx for me, didn't bother to explain the drug to me at all."

,I believe a class action lawsuit is in order here.
,This drug is not for me!
,I was extremely depressed and anxious all the time.
,By the third day he had extreme shortness of breath – it is hard to get upstairs or get the mail.
,My skin feels hypersensitive.
,I gained weight.
,"This week though, I had the MONSTER of headaches and stuffiness out of nowhere."
,Decided the benefits out weighed the side effects.
,Worked about the same as any anti-depressant has for me.
,remember everyone is different and its always worth giving a shot.
,"Not a ""cure"" but it does help."
,"Don't listen to all the negative press here, see what works for you."

,This went on for days and days.
,"Side effects began when taking Nexium, stopped after taking the drug."
,Used for around a month and a half in conjunction with Geodon and Saphris.
,But the suffering i went through with this drug was worse the then what they were prescribed for.
,"At first I had some minor sexual side effects (no problems with erection, but I did have delayed ejaculation), but those side effects disappeared after a few months."
,Oddly enough the best remedy was crushed ice and tons of water.
,"I had an increased gag reflex and a loss of appetite for the first week with both dosages, but they went away."
,"Although the Cipralex helped me with my anxiety at first, I was sleepy all day, gained almost 30 pounds + my libido was non existent."

,"Started on 30mg first week, 60mg after that."
,It worked wonders for my Fibro pain.
,Side effects began 3 days ago.
,My husband and my children comment on what a good mood I have been in since being on Cymbalta and I can tell myself such a difference in my anxiety level.
,Tried Zoloft and many other meds.
,Don't look forward or dread anything particularly.
,I am glad I did because it's really helped me without making me feel less like myself.
,"I have no family history of health problems of any kind, not even in my extended family, not even heart disease or diabetes or anything."

,Just a little note of your not the only one.
,"The result was that I had reflux 75% of the time, yet only had 'mild' reflux then and was not aware of it!"
,"Cymbalta has changed my whole perspective on life - instead of just trying to get through the days, I am enjoying life, my family, friends, and hobbies so much more."

,The hip pain is back.
,Had NO difficulty with discontinuing the med other than headaches the first few days.

,"After about 3 years of daily use, I began experiencing arthitis like joint pain in my elbows and hands at first which has since spread through my entire body."
,I have 2 little ones and was very dangerous being that tired constantly---didn't matter how little/much sleep I got.
,I owe it to others to share my experience.
,I have to take alot of meds.
,I have only taken Celebrix for 2 days.
,MRI set up by emergency doctor  in 2012 with no report of anything abnormal.
,Out of all of the psychotrophic drugs that I have taken (and there has been A LOT of them) this one has been the most beneficial.
,My extremely patient husband began to lose patience with me!
,I have been on the this and prilosec for years...

,"I have been taking 40mg a day for the past week, and the main side effect has been a constant feeling of hunger, ever right after i have eaten a meal."
,Then I got a sudden urge to get up and ran to the bathroom to vomit like crazy.
,"Finally, some dear friends and my husband let me know the changes they were seeing and thus started the decision to stop taking the drug."
,For about three months I thought the Nexium had actually cured my heart burn and I wouldn't have to take it anymore but unfortunately the GERD slowly came back and I eventually had to go on to a similar product.

,I almost wish I had never started taking it.

,"I immediately stopped the Wellbutrin (after 1wk), got back on the Cymbalta (currently rampimg up at 30mg/day) and I feel better almost immediately."
,I did try aciphex which had the same sym
,CFS/FM robbed me of life.
,Did not get constipated or diarrhea but I also came up with a severe case of lymphatic colitis AT LEAST 5 months before the cymbalta was started and took meds for that with regularity.
,"Will continue to take it for another few months, but stopped the Remeron."
,"And already I feel better, have more energy and in general feel like a wait has been lifted off my shoulders."
,"For anxiety, Paxil was much better but made me gain weight."
,I'm tired of trying different Rxs.

,How this drug was ever approved and deemed safe is beyond me!
,"However, this time I've been taking it for about 3 weeks now and I am having so many side effects."
,The first day after I took Cymbalta I thought I thought my lung has collapsed.
,"For all the people making comments about people having ""problems"", for me to go from a young healthy 27 year old man and in the span of a month turning into what felt like a 90 year old man is not crap."

,anyone else want to talk about your side effects email me!
,I won't even go near the samples he gave me.
,"It took a while, and a few uptitrations, but it is my miracle medication."
,Doctor was clueless and oblivious to severe withdrawal.
,I was on nexium 40 mg once a day for about 2 months and then my dr increased my medication to 40mg twice daily due to still having gerd symptoms.
,I saw my dr who wanted to put me on a low dose to help w/withdrawal but I refused...I never want that drug in my body again.

,This med stopped the harrowing bout of depression and suicidal obsessions.
,It has made my life immeasurably better.
,Because I feel like my condition has worsened I stopped taking the medication.
,This drug has given me a new lease on life..Before Cymbalta I was on Lexapro and did not look or feel depressed.
,I took this drug both alone (for 2 years) and in combination with other meds (such as welbutrin).
,Cymbalta completely changed my life.
,On day 12 I got a fever of 101 F and felt like a crap.
,Am hoping this will address my ongoing depression and anxiety (since October).

,My doctor says to try taking every other day to start with.
,I don't hurt.
,I need my brain back!
,"I'm really disappointed in the side effect....and rather 'bummed out' that I have to stop taking it, because it truly worked wonders on the pain aspect of the fybromyalgia."
,"I've suffered from GAD for quite a long time, and this drug works wonders."
,"I had 20 lbs to lose before starting cymbalta, now I have about 23."
,One thing about Cymbalta is that I no longer like the taste of alcohol so I don't drink anymore whereas before I started taking it I was drinking about 2-3 drinks per night.
,It may help some but I would not recommend for long term use.
,I feel wonderful again.
,Only been taking Cymbalta for 2 weeks and think i am going to switch back to Wellbutrin.
,It also seems to give me energy as it keeps my seasonal depression at bay.
,So far this medicine is the greatest thing in the world for me!
,I had never taken anti-depressants before.
True,"It worked wonders for the pain though, and I really feel bad that I cannot continue on it because of the side effects I experienced."
,I had to do the research myself to find out why these things were happening to me.
,"I have swelling at the base of my neck, joint and muscle pain, severe fatigue, increased appetite, weight gain, vertigo, hair loss, and recently diagnosed anemia!"
,Very good for pain but made me very tired next day and all day until 6 or 7pm.
,I think people are more inclined to post on these sites when they've had a bad time with a drug than when things are going well.
,I tried going on the generic form of prilosec for two months (insurance doesn't cover nexium) and the choking came back immediately while taking the generic version.
,I am going to meet with my doctor to see if there is something else out there that may be able to help without the weight gain.
,"Tuesday after 30 mgs, I experienced diarrhea all day long, dizziness, nausea and brain zaps."
,"If it doesn't, don't."
,Sxs are better but not sure which is helping.
,I am terrified to miss a dose because I NEVER want to feel that level of continual dizziness again.
,My wife would have two Orgasms and then it would take me 20-30 minutes.
,I also get very dizzy.

,I should have been in the hospital at least twice.
,"Have only been on drug for one week, and already I can see I am not getting the creeped-out feeling I have from a half dozen other antidepressants I have tried."
,Not until I checked it and cross-referenced it (symptoms with meds) did I find the connection.
,"In 2006 GERD pain returned, I had Endoscopy, and Colonoscopy."
,I will be interested in what happens in the next weeks.

,"Really helpful with depression, but I have had the bloating etc that everyone talks about."
,"I had buzzing noises in my head, no energy, nervousness and irritability and many other side effects from withdrawal symptoms."
,This is a wonder drug!

,i've considered suicide when the rainbow is NEVER enough.
,"Was surprised at the level of CNS involvement, and what a vegetable I became."
,The only side effect that was constant was the inability to sleep well and felt jittery all the time.
,I was put on Prilosec and then Nexium.
,"Has anyone else had my constipation or other problems and if so, what have you successfully changed to?"
,I'm opting for acupuncture and bland foods to help me heal...
,I started out on 30mg for 30 days and then increased dosage to 60mg which I am still taking.
,In the last year I have gained 20 lbs.
,Doctors don't seem to realize this drug is only to be taken 4-8 weeks.
,Cymbalta didn't even relieve my depression symptoms fully and I am not increasing my dosage because the side effects bother me.
,I have also worried that my brain chemistry has been irreparably damaged.
,I'd rather deal with the reflux and stomach aches than not be able to feed my son.
,"Admittedly the comments about this drug concern me, if this is a good thing why does it do so much damage coming off of it?"
,sex drive went capuoi which is hard.
,I think this is for more severe anxiety.
,Every day for 3 weeks.
,I think perhaps I was having a allergic reaction.
,This lasted for over four months and put my family and myself through torture!

,For the first couple of weeks Cymbalta seemed to work.
,Nothing had worked before.

,Excessive bowel movements.
,40 mg nexium once per day worked for a while then it started to not work the entire day.
,"Cymbalta has had no effect on joint or muscle pain for me, unsure if related to depression."

,This morning the fatigue and dizziness are gone.

,Had nightmares with images flashing thru my mind at super speed as if my synapses had gone haywire and were exploding.
,!Should have used my better judgement and went the natural way.
,The withdrawal was horrific!
,"Then I found this website, which seemed to include the good and the bad."
,"But the sweating and the insomnia are VERY problematic, as I am exhausted."
,Extremely happy with the initial start... No acid reflux or heartburn at night!
,"Before taking Nexium, I was only getting GERD symptoms."
,"Felt wired one day, and have been grinding my teeth ever since."
,"Also, it seems as though this drug isn't a great treatment for anything other than depression/axiety."
,What a difference... farting went away and I feel much healthier.
,I will do anything aside from ever take anything like this again!!!
,Yesterday I was spacy and just exhausted.
,"Then, just as quickly, the pain came back."
,The Drug worked perfect for me.

,I switched to Pristiq which was not effective so I stopped it.
,It seems like some people have such horrid side effects and others dont.
,Good luck to everyone

,I am now trying to wean off it am in my second week of hell.

,Highly reconsider taking this med if you have not already done so.
,I am taking the med back to the pharmacy for them to dispose of.
,In the past six months I've started feeling odd and having weird side-effects.
,"Started with 60mg/day, major loss of libido."

,I lost weight and felt great.
,"I figured that the ""stress and anxiety"" was the culprit for the stomache bloating/gas and neck and shoulder stiffness, that's what my doctor pinned it on."
,"Worked the best of any medication, including Effexor."
,No heartburn yet!
,Helped my depression very much (I was taking Celexa before but still experiencing depression).
,The first two weeks of side effects were annoying but definitely worth it.

,i have been pretty healty all my life and now that i know this information i will share with other in my situation.
,"At 5 in the morning, I was discharged and had to walk back to the Clinic as I had no phone or money."

,I am going to do my best to manage my GERD with famotidine.
,i'd been on assorted pain meds for the nerve pain from a ruptured disc in my neck.
,"I initially started with 60mg, but intended to titrate off the medication, so I slowly reduced my doseage to 30mg- where I currently remain."
,I was on plaquenil for 9 months and it was literally killing me.
,the withdrawal symptoms are magnified in what i just said.
,This drug is dangerous!
,It is quite capable of killing.
,I can't miss one dose of this medication or my stomach ulcers will flare-up to the point that I am extremely sick.
,My memory is very bad.
,No terrible side effects so far.
,not sure that the good outweigh the bad...
,it helps w/the depression but I still feel pretty lousy - just bounce back a little easier
,"Those symptoms only lasted 1-2 days, but they come back if I ever miss a day and then take it again the next day."
,I'm trying to hang in there with the WB/cymbalta combo but the constant feeling I'm on speed and inability to sleep (I take ambien) may force me to give up.

,(except when I'm having a psychotic episode) I had very few noticiable side effects to begin with.

,I am back down to 107 but have had a reoccurrence and have to go back on a PPI.
,I have been fine since - with side effects listed - on the big 120 dose.

,The jaw clenching is beyond annoying though...I feel like I need to walk around with my mouth wide open to avoid doing it...hoping that will go away.
,I don't believe that my doctor understands why I got the hiccups from my surgery to rebuild the sphincter at the bottom of my esophagus and so he put me on nexium and it has not helped to make them hurt less or go away.

,"When I came off Cymbalta I had the worst side effects I could've ever imagined...it's been a few weeks and still have horrible effects...extreme muscle fatigue and muscle cramping and elevated liver enyzmes (no pre-existing liver damage or alcohol use/abuse,) just to name a few."

,Cymbalta only relieved my anxiety.
,I now experience anxiety and rapid heart rate and elevated blood pressure.
,"That's what I'm supposed to feel, right?"
,"Well, it seems that the Nexium has increased my anxiety and last night, I awoke to a panic-like attack and I just feel edgy now."
,I am taking back my health.
,The only annoying symptom was a slight worsening of my insomnia until I started noticing that my heart was regularly missing beats.

,After 24 hrs from taking it I still feel queasy and drugged.I have severe insomnia and don't want to risk getting worse.

,Initially I was taking 20 mg in the morning (eventually increased to 60 mg) for pain and bipolar disorder and 150 mg of Topomax in the evening to promote weight loss (which did not work) and the bpd as well.
,I can not sleep it is 2:00 am right now and I cannot function very well at work due to stomach pain.
,I'm SOOO glad I did.
,I began taking 60 mg of Cymbalta and was so tired that I slept the entire day after a couple of days of taking it...I didn't even answer my phone when my boss called to my house looking for me.
,Once I ate the pain went away.
,It never occured to me that a well known drug like Nexium could cause me so much discomfort.
,"Regardless, I have been off Nexium for 4 days, and I'm using the Slo Mag - and the past 3-4 days have been markedly better."

,Awful!
,I never noticed any pain relief or extra energy.
,I really wish companies provided more info and did more research on sexual side effects of medications on women.
,I am taking it in combination with Welbutrin.
,I've had all kinds of tests done which indicated I was fine so I started to research my symptoms myself.
,"I've tried Trileptal, Elavil, Lyrica, Neurontin & a couple others which never helped me at all."
,I still sweat like crazy.
,It worked..I feel like I can deal with stress; I can focus and concentrate again.

,"Now that I'm used it, the side effects have subsided."
,"I've had brain zaps, nausea, vertigo, body and muscle pain, irritation and rage, and many other symptoms."
,a lifesaver.
,I asked my doctor if there could be any correlation between long term use of Nexium and the on-going symptoms I'm having.
,I have never had any problems with it but recently started suffering unusual sensations feelings etc.

,"!I can just imagine what this drug has done to the inside of my stomach.I can't believe it.My Sister is a pharmacist & owns her own pharmacy(where I work by the way).These are ""NOT"" side effects listed on the bottle.It worked wonders for me at the beginning but now,when I run out of it..the acid reflux is unbearable.Wish I knew why though.Now I'am really scared...I'am going to have to go to an Upper GI Specialist & get a camera in there to see how bad it is.Even my Hp Lori test came back positive.They should take it off the market!We should sue their butts!!!"
,Just be careful of what you eat and exercise often and regularly.
,this feeling eventaully develops into a pleasant feeling much like being STONED on marijuana.
,"was on Zoloft for probably 10 years and thought I would try Cymbalta due to its claim to help fibromyalgia and that it wouldn't cause weight gain...felt much, much better on the Zoloft and just started back on it today..."
,This purple pill has way too many side effects.
,This stuff is like rat poison!!!
,First drug I've taken.
,I switch to Cymbalta because of some weight gain issues from Lexapro which I had been taking for over 2 years .
,"Took it for a while, and it proved to be helpful."
,As of today my dr. told me not to take it for about 4-5 days and then let him know how I feel.
,"I feel so much better now than when I was taking all those pills, Which was when I was in the hosp."
,I am stopping this as of this moment.
,No problems from the NEXIUM so far and no more holes(ulcers).
,There are side effects with cymbalta but they are more manageable.
,Positive benefit - decreased appetite helped me lose and keep off 15 pounds.
,I suppose that is enough.
,I do not recommend this drug too many side effects.
,Cold turkey without any withdrawl symptoms.
,"If you don't trust your doctor, then you probably need to see a new one."
,"I don't get so emotional over silly things, my thinking is clearer and I use better judgement when making decisions."
,The evidence for me is irrefutable; Cymbalta has absolutely no redeeming value when compared to any other type of SSRI anti-depressant.
,I wanted to run outside and shout to anyone that would listen.
,I have no desire to do anything.
,Everything became 30 times worse.
,"Horrible drug, my doctor put me on it because of my RSD both for pain and he thought I was depressed??"
,Take with extreme caution.
,"I am very happy with the drug, and the forgetfullness could just be me."
,"My physician suggested depression, at which I baulked -- I figured it was anxiety, or stress, or just ""life catching up with me."""
,"Consequently, I was placed on anti-depressants to counteract the side effects of pain medication, and also because the constant pain sucked the life out of me."
,I was sent to see many specialist to try and diagnose my medical mystery.
,Can't spell.
,My Dr. upped the dosage to 90mg.
,I was prescibed nexium from a suspected ulcer or gastritis.
,"I have suffered from anxiety (anxiety attacks), bouts of depression, sadness and anger since I was a young teen."
,Said it was side effects of med.
,I WILL STOP TAKING THIS DRUG BECAUSE OF THE TOXINS  AND SINCE I HAVE HYPERSENSITIVITIES WHICH IS PROBABLY THE PROBLEM WITH THIS DRUG!!!!!!!!
,Was worked up for stroke and MS but this was negative.
,This is so much better than the Prozac/Wellbutrin cocktail I was on.
,I feel very lucky because i had very severe GERD.
,This med really has helped with my anxiety.
,"Currently, I take 40 mg Cymbalta plus 300mg Wellbutrin daily."
,I flushed this crap.
,A neurologist suggested that I might have early neuropathy.
,I don't want to go back to 30mg because I still experienced occasional panic and anxiety attacks.
,THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO DIE UNTIL I STARTED TAKING CYBALTA.
,"3 months later was fired unjustly from job, and depression started all over again."
,Cymbalta has stablized me.
,"Always emotionally ""up"" no matter what."
,"No horrible side effects with Cymbalta however, and a missed dose never led to brain zaps, like Effexor XR."
,"Sweating constantly, and feeling hot ALL the time."
,"Cymbalta did lift my depression a bit, but not enough to continue."
,I withdrawled from cymbalta a few months ago it took me 4 months to have my DR tell me I need it again.
,"I tried Prilosec but my heartburn continued, and then developed a pain on the right side of my chest under the breast bone, worsened after eating."
,"Withdrawls are horrible, but no ""sweats and flushing""."
,My RA doctor suggested Cymbalta because of my pain with Osteoarthritis.
,"I haven't noticed any difference yet, but I was able to keep down half of the tostada I ate yesterday... but only half."
,Terrible dry mouth and leg cramps at night.
,I actually slammed my head through a wall and had thoughts of unimaginable evil rage during the outburst.
,Worst withdrawal symptoms I've ever experienced.
,I wake up every morning and can;t wait to take my happy pain free medication.
,Be aware that this medication is different for everyone but it was NOT the drug for me.
,That evening my left leg was achy.
,the trick to taking Nexium is for people to read the instructions.
,I'm sure with time I will feel so much better.
,The first few weeks were tough (getting adjusted) but now that I am starting to see and live with the benefits I am glad I stuck with it.
,The worst pains I've had for many years.
,"Seems to have settled stomach down a bit, but not sure if i can deal with the constant feeling of illness."
,I had a few drinks one evening with friends and had severe vomiting.
,I literally spent thousands of dollars at doctors trying to figure out what was wrong with me.
,"i try to reach orgasm, but if i don't, i am not discouraged, and maybe that is the cymbalta working to not make me depressed, i'm not sure."
,in the first 10 days alone) which is a plus.I eat a 1/4 of what I used to before the Cymbalta.
,I wish I had found this board about this class of drugs before started it.
,Be extremely careful if you take this drug.
,Anything that messes with your Brain and starts shocking your body like that has to be dangerous.Don't know the long term effects yet.
,I now want OFF of it.
,Actually optimistic about my future!
,I also had a pleural effusion and was hospitalized for over a day.
,"Thank you in advance,  jm"
,I eat when I'm hungry.
,ok  so i feel ok now that I got through the side effect stage.
,"Then as I walked I was dizzy, then vertigo hit."
,There have been pros and cons to my experience with this medication but the cons are starting to outweigh the pros so I plan to wean off of it in the coming months under my physician's care.
,"This medicine is not a cure-all, but it definitely helped me get back on track and feel better!"
,GERD was under control the whole time but after about 8 months numerous flushing experiences developed that felt like my blood pressure was dropping through the floor but actually wasn't.
,Absolutely horrible for me.
,"It happened when I'd get up...I'd feel strange, almost unbalanced, then the electrical shock feeling would kick in."
,"I agree that they need to take another closer look at the medicine and if possible, pull it from the market."
,"I tried Webutrin, and that hadn't done anything."
,Withdrawal was horrible.
,"Sleep better, ache less but now have gained over 10 lbs."
,"I am very active and work out most days, but lately I have had to push through the day."
,this is the FIRST medication that has worked 100%.IT SAVED MY LIFE.
,I HAD to have a milkshake everyday or something from Dairy Queen made with chocolate and drenched with extra chocolate (the people working there thought I was nutty for all the extra fudge I requested).
,I was not able to afford it and stopped taking it and the results were DISASTER!
,I started taking it at nite and now I am having trouble sleeping at night.
,I started out on 30 for 2 weeks then upped to 60.
,Worst withdrawal I've ever experienced.
,"I notified the company, because I believe these are incredibly dangerous side effects that need to be looked at, although I doubt they will study it."
,"Nexium maybe efficient against acid reflux, but it is DANGEROUS."
,Never had a problem and never had a pain once I stopped taking it.
,"now, after being on it for 4 months, this second time is so much better."
,I have only been on Cymbalta for 2days but I am having really bad headaches in the back of my head that I have never had before.
,"Por el momento puedo decir que  vale la pena tomarlo, pocos efectos secundarios comparados con otros que tome, mi autoestima y seguridad  volvieron y sobre todo la fatiga que era lo que mas problemas me causaba esta desapareciendo,"
,It certainly isn't helping-- and I will know over the course of time -- whether all of this is actually coming totally from the  Nexium.
,There were times where it made me feel even more anxious than I already was.
,During the time I was taking this drug I was waking up at night due to my heart raising like I had just ran a marathon.
,The day started out ok.
,I have to highly rate this med.
,I am a high functioning individual who was very debilitated by Nexium (and Prevacid).
,DO Not stop this medication cold turkey.
,"Until taking Nexium, I've never experienced such a thing."
,"Finally, I went back to the doc again and he switched me to cymbalta."
,"I was getting worse and worse, did my research and yep..I was right."
,I have severe insomnia and don't want to risk getting worse.
,My migraines came back after a year and they upped the dose to 60 mg.
,Would NEVER recommend.
,I wanted to see if changing to cymbalta helped my memory.
,Cymbalta has increased my quality of life as my pain is now at a tolerable level.
,"The second day I was still cold, couldn't eat, but the nausea turned into vomiting."
,"I have tried every drug in the book, either Im allergic or makes things worse."
,"I have since been to a Nature Path, Gastrointerologist, Allergist and Immunologist, as well as the Gynocologist that I work for, to try to figure out what has been causing my abd pain and excessive weight gain (40+ lbs)."
,I cried all the time.
,"I will be speaking with my doctor about another medicine I can take, during my upcoming visit."
,"After suffering from several herniated discs in my neck and spending over a year living on narcotic pain relievers, I began suffering from anxiety."
,Decided to stop taking cymbalta and the withdrawals are HORRIBLE!
,They just want to push the pills on you.
,"I have a friend whose husband takes this drug for fibromyalgia and tried to get off it because they can't afford this medicine, but the withdrawal was so bad for him."
,"Also felt an intense, drunken buzzing in my head on the first few days of Zoloft, so will just have to give Cymbalta time."
,Does anyone have any ideas?
,I will stop using tomorrow to see if symptoms taper off.
,I found that I just did not care about anyone or anything anymore.
,I cannot believe that doctors would prescribe this to their patients if they truly new all the terrible side effects.
,My GAD controlled my life since I couldn't handle any stressful situation but thanks to duloxetine I can have a normal life again

,Worked great for about 4 day until the fore-mentioned side effects kicked in and made me stop taking it.
,Symptoms progressively got worse.
,(I am on 13 because I have an autoimmune disease).
,"I think If someone needs to be on a PPI, nexium is the way to go but I understand everyone might react differently to each PPI."
,It is just unfortunate that it is so expensive and insurance companies do not want to cover it.

,"AROUND THANKSGIVING, I WAS CRYING CONSTANTLY AND VERY DOWN."
,Two physical side effects worsened over time--pain in my bladder that was horrible (I thought I had a bladder infection but I didn't) and increased hunger.
,The first month I took Cymbalta was great!
,I'm feeling totally back to normal now and my gerd is better most of the time.
,I recommend this drug to anyone
,Doctor said that 60 mg is the optimal dose but I think it is too much for me becasue I am waking up several times a night.
,But no.
,The ER had me on Nexium IV (it did stop the bleeding) and I had to take it for 6 wks after.
,I would recommend this medication - Wellbutrin didn't do a thing for me.
,I am glad to feel anything because that means I dont have to wait 30 days for it to do what it is supposed to do.
,I have been taking Nexium for about 10 years now.
,Family and friends want me to continue on Cymbalta indefinitely.
,My doctor seems to think it will help with the nausea.
,Then the spinning type of dizziness began.
,"Breathlessness, indigestion ensued."
,Weaned off from 120 back to 60 mgs once every two days for one week.
,But few weeks later all my symptoms came back.
,"NO, I repeat NO side effects except sexual dysfunction, if that's an issue to you personally."
,"MY LIFE WAS A MISERY BEFORE TAKING NEXIUM,I LIVED ON ASILONE AND GAVISCON BOTH OF WHICH ONLY HELPED A LITTLE."
,"I usually don't have problems with new medication, but after taking nexium, I am convinced that this is what is causing my side effects."
,I do believe we wouldn't have the anxiety and depression if we didn't  experience so many sudden unexplained symptoms  while on nexium.
,My daughter has been on this medicine ever since her gallbladder was removed.
,I am now on 90 mg. My doctor suggested I try 120 mg.

,"Not 100% sure about it's sexual impact, as I may have had too much on my mind, but I suspect it is the case after reading other comments."
,"I'm not sure I can tell a difference yet, I had to stop taking my mood stabilizer and haven't gotten on a different one yet so it's hard to say."
,So far I've been alright as I'm only missing one dose a week.
,"So far nausea is my worst side effect, and some drowsiness."

,I lost all feeling and control of my bladder for an undetermined amount of time.
,My Doctor has done every test imaginable to find out what is wrong with me.

,Any side effects for me are better than the blackness of depression.
,I've been chronically depressed since I was a teen and it has worsened over time.
,"It is now two days later, and I'm still barely able to function!"
,I am astonished at how both the high risk of suicide AND the serious risk of fatal liver damage are barely mentioned in the endless TV ads for this toxic medication.
,I'm just afraid it will eventually render me apathetic and flat the way Prozac eventually did.
,The first 3 wks of Cymbalta made me very nauseous and I had no appetite.
,JUST MAKE SURE YOU HAVE SOMEONE WATCHING YOU and you are following up with your doctor
,The withdrawal I heard was also a pain.
,"I feel no side effects at this point, 15 days into a 30mg dose daily."
,I would recommend people to be aware of the side effects of any medicine!

,"muscle spasasms, deafing ringing in the ears."
,Waiting for the anit-anxiety effect to kick in.
,Don't feel as blue.

,Quite a price to pay for only a brief period of relief.

,I am now suffering with the worst of withdrawal symptoms as frequently stated throughout these postings.
,"I would like to cut back to 30 to see if the ear ringing subsides, but am feeling so good I hesitate to rock the boat."
,"Once I stopped the cymbalta, the lamictil was useless."
,Whoa!
,I am weaning off this drug after a year at a variety of dosages.
,i believe most of you know what i mean.
,"CT scan and gastroscopy revealed nothing of the sort, but he is determined to find a diagnosis."
,I really think that it is cool that my bad dreams have gone away.
,Saw cardiologist who put me on medication to control now permanent problem.
,"It took a few weeks to get used the ""fuzzy"" feeling in my head and decreased appetite, but then no problems..that's until the hair loss !"
,I had to quit taking my Cymbalta when I got pregnant and never experienced any of the withdrawl people talk about here.
,"I went off it, and felt fine for a while, but then hit a low as I had never had before."
,"most of my current side effects are not everyday, but enough."
,Should be taken off market.
,Helped with depression but not with anxiety.
,Doctors and drug companies are just making us sicker and sicker each year.
,"I confessed to our family physician that I was experience severe bouts of anger (I went so far as to throw a lit cigarette at my husband the day before because he wouldn't ""leave me alone) and I've never experienced anger like that before -- I am the most passive, peaceful person on the planet."
,Those who have suicidal thoughts and tendoncies on this drug should obviously talk to your doctor and get off immediately.
,"And I'm 50 pounds overweight, so I'm not complaining about the decreased appetite!"
,Starting in the third week and continuing on until I stopped the drug were the more severe side effects that I listed.
,I might need a higher dose for my anxiety though.
,but the cymbalta is a great tool for helping me to concur the depression and the social anxiety.
,I feel better than I have in a very long time!
,I have had my symptoms now for 2 1/2 months straight.
,Helped inprove my memory and panic attoks
,She had just went to a seminar on the study of cymbalta.
,"Everyday, I wake up thinking that this is the day that I will feel better...but it never is."
,"If you take this med with food, you won't feel as nauseus either."
,I stopped taking the Nexium after I read the testimonials on this site.
,"I have only been taking this for a short amount of time, but I don't know if I can handle the side effects."
,I will be honest and say that it did provide me with relief initially but in recent weeks I have had several of the symptoms described by others here (see symptoms) A couple of times I was sure I was having a heartache or something else serious was presenting itself.
,"This is my fourth antidepressant (lexapro, effexor and the new Valdoxan did not work at all)."
,Next came the shortness of breath and the feeling of being squeezed if I inhaled deeply.
,I've been on it close to 2 years and am now having more side effects than benefits.
,I've been taking cymbalta since June 2006.
,"After 2 weeks on this drug, the pain is gone."
,I feel that all depression medications have this side effect and I am determined to get off of this medication and start taking the natural route.
,I felt like I needed to be hospitalised.
,"Overall, Cymbalta gave me way more to worry about than it ever helped."
,"The only good thing I have to say about cymbatla is that it does take care of anxiety, but I would imagine that a simple SSRI would provide the same results without the unwanted side effects."
,In 2007 I started taking cymbalta and it changed my life.
,"After trying all others, this drug has given me a sense of calm and feeling of contentedness that I never knew others lived with."
,I have been on Cymbalta for nine months.
,"I took Zoloft on and off for 12 years, and found I have fewer negative reactions to Cymbalta."
,"I SWITCHED TO THE 60 MG DOSE 2 DAYS AGO & THE BEGINNING UNPLEASNT SIDE EFFECTS ARE RETURNING AGAIN, SMOKING POT REALLY HELPS WITH THE NAUSEA."
,i will not go into detail but will say that cymbalta turned me into a monster.
,From what I've been reading it sounds like I have a long horrible road ahead of me.
,The withdrawal symptoms are nothing sort of a nightmare.
,"I like the way I feel as compared to other depression meds I've tried,and my husband can see a difference in me in only a month."
,"The Cymbalta was great while it lasted, about a year, but now I am switching to Wellbutrin, specifically because of the lack of sex drive on Cymbalta."
,I don't really have panic attacks on this medicine.
,The heart palpitations and chest pains have disappeared.
,i started taking  for severe depression and at first it seemed to help.
,"By the time I had been on 30mg for a month and went up to 60mg, I had more energy and was noticeably more cheerful."
,I suffered frquent crying spells and greater depression than when I started taking the drug.
,I am still experiencing pain in my lower legs and elbows.
,This makes me not want to get off it so I keep putting it off.
,"OMG, I am so glad to know that I will not have this horrible constant buzzing for ever."
,I would recommend giving this medication a try if you have been unsuccessful with others and waiting a good 6 weeks before changing.
,"been on in for about 3 weeks rhumo guy wanted me to try it.....have to say its the best thing i have ever tried, the pain re-fibro is hardly there now and i can function again...altho there are side effects they are nothing in comparison to the pain so there fore i am loving this ' wonder' drug...obviously my mood has lifted too, i was apprehensive as i had done research on the net prior to taking the drug ....but it is working for me, i have missed taking the tablet a few times due to been forgetful on it..however i did not experience any other side effects, so i am lucky really, the only thing i have noticed apart from the minor side effects is the sex part however thats no big deal and a small price to pay to be out of pain, i guess!"
,I roughly saw 2-3 hours of sleep a night while taking Ambien to sleep.
,"I ran out of meds and suffered confusion, vertigo, loss of control - but got back on and things have been great!"
,Was taking two Skelaxin twice a day just to move - now I am taking none.
,"To sum it up, Cymbalta is a good medicine to try if nothing else is helping and especially if you have fibro and depression."
,I was prescribed Nexium to help with some stomach/acid issues I'd been having.
,I usually know better and this is a way to painful reminder.
,"I've always been a bigger person, now I'm obese and on BP meds as well."
,"First I saw my primary care Doctor, then three specialists who suspected everything imaginable including Osteoporosis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, STD’s, Lyme Disease, and  Cancer."
,While getting of 60 Mg. Daily of cymbalta my anxiety had me vibrating.
,I have energy and confidence that I did not have before.
,I'm willing to deal with itchy skin and not eat if it will get rid of the depression.
,Even one day without Cymbalta brings on pretty severe depressive symptoms.
,I won't be repeating that anytime soon.
,"Once I get off of this physically and mentally addicting drug, I will never take it again!!!"
,I had to drive home w/all the windows down (even though it was only 45 degrees that morning).
,"After being on the drug for 4 weeks, I was able to achieve orgasm after trying for about 2 hours."
,"I have not had any nightmares, maybe even decreased dreaming which is okay because it gives my mind a chance to switch off."
,"Also, I feel very tired and light headed with minor dizziness."
,The docs never seem to relate any symptoms to the drugs you are taking.
,I have had no sexual side effects.
,Evidently there is supposed to be a step-up period but some drs are misinformed.
,The ear ringing (a problem I've never had) has gotten worse over  the past 2 1/2 weeks.
,"I stopped the Cymbalta cold turkey about three days ago and, for me, it has not been particularly oppressive."
,"Taking 30 mg for chronic back pain, and depression."
,"I was able to stop Cymbalta cold turkey with no problems, but I also immediately started taking Pristiq and I've remained on Wellbutrin XL, which may have minimized any withdrawal symptoms."
,I do still have days where I just want to lay in bed but not nearly like before.
,Life-changing.
,I feel for all my fellow depression sufferers...we probably are at the mercy of the drug co.'s.
,So Far I really haven't had an real side effects to speak of.
,The side effects are annoying but I can't go off of the medication either.
,Nexium is the only prescription drug I have taken for years.
,"I took lyrica at first, it also worked but never could adjust to the horrible side effects."
,.
,I have wasted the entire day.
,"No more feeling in a ""black"" mood, and sadness."
,It does help relieve pain however in joints
,"I've noticed that I recognize the situation, but the drug takes the edge off."
,This drug is HELL.
,60 mgs every other day instead of every day.
,"That's the deep, good kind."
,By the third capsule I could roll over in bed without pain.
,ANGRY!!!
,WHY DON'T THEY KNOW?
,Cymbalta worked on my hip pain almost immediately.
,I do not even know why my doctor put me on Nexium after endoscopic exam as Omeprazole worked fine for me before gastro-endoscopic examination.
,"and I wasn't taking this for mental issues, just to help with pain in right hip as it prevented me from walking and caused balance issues."
,I think this medicine is making it easier to concentrate.
,I am slowly getting my life back from severe depression.
,"I almost gave up on it and after a full month it hit over a few days and it IS pleasant, especially compared to the depressive ""life"" style."
,I will never take this drug again.
,This lasted until 6:00.
,"Still not making the connection between his symptoms and the Nexium, he started taking it again upon his release from the hospital."
,"Within an hour of taking the very first pill, I felt 1000 times better!"
,The worst for me though was the anger I felt.
,Horrible drug - when I mentioned side effects to Doctor he increased the meds to 2/day.
,So 22 months later and tired of being told that I was just out of shape and could lose some of the 15 pounds that I am over weight I was at a loss.
,"I will never, ever take this pill again!"
,Within 2 hours of taking it my stomach bloated so much that I couldn't wear my (loose-fitting) jeans.
,"I researched this site, and was surprised to see how many side"
,By February 2007 I was feeling musch better.
,After multiple trips to the ER and specialists with normal results im starting to realize it has to be the nexium!
,I would advise people not to take it for anything else - it is a very potent drug.
,now people can actually tolerate me!
,And I wonder how you're supposed to extract nutrients from food with no stomach acid.
,"If you decide to take this drug, I would recommend keeping a ""side-effect"" journal; I wish I had started one two years ago."
,"Of course, any of the ppi's will cause you to have severe rebound acid if you miss a day...that's the way that goes, but I will never take another nexium."
,The skin peeling was especially distressing because my fingertips and lips were extremely sore and sensitive for a long time-- I quit the drug after 2 weeks (30mg daily) because I could not tolerate any of these side effects.
,No more nexium for me.
,"About 2 weeks later, I was on the train when all of a sudden I felt like I was going to faint."
,I am much kinder and don't have dramatic moods and uncontrollable emotions.
,"However, all the possible causes were eliminated through testing except food allergies."
,Felt no pain at all and experienced happier moods.
,It's been 2 weeks off of it and I feel agitated and cry all the time.
,"upon discontinuing it, I experienced major withdrawl symptoms which were never explained to me."
,I guess nobody can say if any med is good or not until you try it.
,I would like to WARN everyone to NOT take this drug.
,I recently became ill and nauseated...causing me to stop taking my meds...including Cymbalta.
,I am a PA.
,I have good days and bad days.
,After being hooked up to sensors I found out that I stop breathing up to 51 times per hour.
,This drug is a DRUG.
,I checked with my family doctor before getting my prescription filled and she said it would be okay.
,"In the meantime, I believe the Nexium is making me miserable."
,Looks like as expensive as it is it would work somewhat better.
,I am not taking this again.
,I would like to hear from others.
,I have no appitite and have sleep problems.
,"Before judging this medicine ( not saying some people will have side effects) , you really should find out why you are taking it."
,I will not take this another day.
,I have been the the ER about 5 times and one time with a bout of atrial fibrilation.
,It wasn't until I came upon this site last night and started reading what others had posted that I realized that maybe the Nexium was causing all these other problems.
,"Am wondering how long it takes to ""kick in""?"
,Again every 3 days for next month.
,The neurologist says its because of my migraines
,"Combined with monthly cognitive behavioral therapy every 4-6 weeks (or as needed), regular exercise, healthy eating, and writing in my diary, Cymbalta has improved my mood and outlook and life!"
,Without the meds I would be house bound at best.
,"Tried to get off this crap by dosing down, but, increase pounding tinnitus so bad, had to go back on."
,P.S.
,I would highly recommend Cymbalta.
,All of the GI docs have told me it is the best.
,"I didn't wake up feeling like a 90 year old trying to move since my joints no longer ached, and the constant pressure of anxiety evaporated."
,My fibromyalgia pain is basically gone.
,It's been almost a week since I stopped and I can't wait until this drug has left my system.

,"The weight loss was great, however Cymbalta only slightly reduced my daily pain level"
,"The sexual side effects are difficult to deal with, but not enough to stop taking the"
,It looks like it affects everyone differently from what I'm reading here.
,I was having intense nausea and digestive issues for about a month until the dr put me on nexium.
,I felt terribly anxious and had heart palpitations I didn't understand.
,It was terrible for me...BE CAUTIOUS...they can't even explain HOW it works.
,"My mood is better, the anxiety is gone."
,I no longer had a negative outlook on life and actually looked forward to socializing with people (which used to make me slightly nervous).PLEASE REMEMBER THAT THIS SITE IS BIASED!
,The brain zaps and dizziness are enough to make you ill but I get nauseous and extremely irritable as weil.
,I can't simply stop taking PPI's or my Dr. feels confident I will develop Barret's.
,I know now that I am not going crazy after reading these other passages.
,I have noticed a great deal of alertness with me throughout the day and full of energy hopefully this will continue.
,As far as I'm concerned the hardest part was going to my doctor and telling him I thought I needed help.
,The nausea has gone and I'm now sleeping better at night after two months on 40mg (60mg was too much for me.)
,"Quite a nasty withdrawal, but I intend to get off it."
,"I have found with my cardiac meds a loss of appetite as with the cymbalta, so I eat 5 or 6 small meals through out the day which helps me to be healthier and keeps my weight normal."
,"I felt its positive effects within a day or two, and pressed through the initial side effects because I was so encouraged by the anti-depressive features."
,"Worked fine for the stomach ulcer pain, but the side effects are worse."
,Within a few days I had my life back.
,Dosage was reduced from 40mg to 20mg.
,I could relate to almost all the other si
,The pharmaceutical companies should be ashamed of how heavily they push their drugs through advertising and free samples.
,In fact I told my husband that my stomach problems were finally over!
,"One every other worked so well, I was scared to mess with it."
,Maybe there's a part of me that's afraid to see what I'm like without antidepressants too.
,Those who are trying to come off Cymbalta should be very careful.
,if anyone else is experiencing the same thing with a loved one please post it.
,Horrible drug.
,"I realized that I was losing weight due to the feeling of fullness, I ate less at night and my meals were smaller."
,the withdrawal (even when reducing gradually) is a living hell and hell visits you in your sleep in a bloody horror movie way.
,My brain did not feel right.
,Feels a bit tantric actually.
,You won't even notice
,"Got an endoscopy which showed I had acid reflux, hiatel hernia and GERD."
,I've been taking Nexium 40mg.for a year now and I can't give this drug enough praise.

,I finally slept for a few hours last night.
,Started at 20mg and felt awesome for a week.
False,I'll update this post in the future if their are any changes.
,Why trade one issue for about half a dozen?
,The weird thing is that about four hours after taking it I felt calm and happier.....but still sick.
,I felt these almost immediately.
,I'm going to look into natural therapy options.
,guess i will try that next.
,"(or a tablet) of apple cider-vinegar after every meal, and ""Heartburn Free"" orange peel extract every other day."

,"I've been having side effects of the new drug since Day 1, but they became much, much worse as I changed dosages."
,"I loved this drug the first few months I was on it, but please be careful on it."
,I have tried Lexapro and Wellbutrin XL first with no improvement in my mood.
,Thanks!
,I stayed on it but then my vision started changing.
,"When u don't digest your food all the way, other health problems begin to occur eventually leading to stomach cancer and/or other serious conditions."
,"It did work great great for my depression, however,  I would only recommend this drug to someone who is so depressed they are suicidal due to the extreme side-effects coming off of it."
,My doctor put me back on it immediately.
,All came back negative.
,"I weaned off with the help of Prozac but felt so awful even after tried other meds.I had brain zaps, dizziness, fear, anxiety attacks, constipation, vertigo, suicidal thoughts, and so many more."
,I'd like to laugh again.
,My biggest question is how long will it take before the blurred vision goes away?
,In summary Nexium helped tremendously with my stomach ulcer and acid reflux.
True,"However, I have taken Cymbalta before and came off with God awful withdrawl."
,Started on 30 and went to 60 mg.
,NEVER TAKE THIS DRUG - STAY AWAY FROM IT -   Nexium was ok for short term when I used it on and off and infrequently.
,Cymbalta will help with depression and anxiety....But the weight gain is causing even more sadness.
,I gained 20 lbs.

,I was dry reaching.
,This medication was not a good choice for me.
,About a half hour later I was shaking violently like I had the flu and I was freezing cold.
,If there's any way you can avoid this drug do it!
,Doc promises Prozac will help...I pray he's right.
,As to my doctor it is unlikely that Nexium is the cause of these side effects.
,Good luck and God bless!

,I not only spoke with my physician but with a pharmacist I have known as a personal friend for twenty years they both agreed that this was a complete personality change for me.

,I am now trapped on 80mg with hellish side effects and if I try to come off the pain is ten times worse than the original condition.
,I do however feel a blunting of my emotional life and I wish that were not the case.
,400 plus random patients testimony all with similiar terrible side effects is the true proof of its makers profiteering ways.
,I felt like I was drugged.
,Getting off of it is no walk in the park either.
,So I ask the doctor to put me on the Nexium.
,I am quite confused with the variety of conditions Cymbalta is prescribed for.

,It's been hard just getting through the day without having to keep laying down.
,i should have taken it a really long time ago.
,Lord only knows how bad Cymbalta withdrawal will be...
,Everything seemed to be positive.
,I tried 6 other SSRIs and had the same trouble.
,"7 weeks later, I'm realizing it is the drugs."
,I believe that drug manufacturers are more interested in profit than cures and therefore don't test their drugs long enough to rule out possible dangerous side effects.

,"Later, I found this site."
,"I realize it has been a Godsend to others, however, I wonder if these people had tried other SSRI’s first in conjunction with other forms of pain management (even the mildest of prescription pain-killers like Ultram would be a much more effective choice)."
,I am now back on my regular dose.
,Dont ever think about taking this drug unless perhaps you are ready to kill yourself!

,"I ran out of my Nexium about 1-1/2 weeks ago close to the weekend and noticed within a couple days that I was not in as much pain, so I thought could the Nexium be making me sick, so I got online and did a search on side effects and could not believe what I found, I have not taken another Nexium."
,"To reduce the dosage, I twist open a 30 mg capsule and remove about a dozen of the time-release pellets, then re-assemble the capsule to leave just the right dose for me."

,The list goes on and on.
,I Did Not Experience The Weight Gain That Some Did (Though Perhaps That Was Because I Tried Living A Pro-Anna Lifestyle

,I am so desperate I have now stopped the drug.
,It seems to be working quite well for me.
,The body will suffer as a result.

,This is the 5th day of my trial with Cymbalta.

,I take a vitamin B complex for the peripheral neuropathy.
,The only thing I came up with (and a doctor agreed) is that long term use of this drug kills the bad bacteria in your system.
,Nausea is one of the symptoms of overgrown HP
,I'm relaxed and able to function like the person I had always been.
,"Had suffered with GERD for at least 20 years, but symptoms got worse with age and increasing weight."

,Now I wear a Fentanyl patch and the pain is well controlled and I have no side effects).
,I stopped taking it altogether because my dizziness and nausea were so bad I almost went to the hospital a few times.
,But the libido and hair loss i can't live with forever..
,Since cymbalta has an extremely short half life it can make you extremly sick upon cessation.
,I found myself waking up several times that evening.
,A great disappointment is the fact that my physician is basically a pharmaceutical shill as opposed to objectively considering that the Nexium may have been the cause of my health issues.
,There are no long term studies of its use and when I bring this up to my doctors they seem to believe the benefits outweigh the risks.I will try again to go off this.
,Woke up at 2:30 with stomach pain and vomiting my guts up.
,I didn't notice any effects at all.
,A total life saver!!

,I will update as I move forward in my withdrawal.
,"If you've been prescribed Cymbalta, please do not take or get off as soon as possible."
,I decided that feeling this good is worth lack of orgasm.
,"I actually opened up the 60mg tabs, and just dip my finger into the beads and take about 10-15 of them (probably about 10mg)."
,I am sleeping with the help of meds 6-7 hours( this is the biggest help).
,"I cannot take serotonin drugs, so what does my doctor do, put me on Cymbalta."
,I did however feel sad a lot and cried easily.
,"And I have major ""brain zaps""."
,All the anxiety and doom and gloom have just dissappeared.
,Its a shame that the side effects can be so harsh as Nexium works really well for bad acid reflux and for some reason has really helped my IBS-D. Wasn't sure all the side effects were Nexium until I read these posts.
,"Changed to inexpensive Prozac without and changes noted, except in my pocketbook."
,It's a small price to pay for so much relief from my others disorders.

,Fluoxetine (Prozac) was the only anti-depressant I had been able to tolerate until I took Cymbalta (it doesn't mess with my norepinephrine levels like Effexor does which Cymbalta is chemically related to).
,Is anyone out there on Cymbalta AND Synthroid?
,Feel much better when I take medication.
,Shaking so violently the trash can is bouncing off the floor with my tremors.
,"However, the side effects started showing up after 6 mo."
,There is no way I could live a functional life on this drug.
,I stopped taking this and boy have I been sick.
,"Once I realized that the drug was causing all my problems, the symptoms slowly went away."
,I won't take Nexium anymore.
,"Headaches, vomiting, insomnia, bouts of crying for NO reason."
,"May be a good drug, but I can't take it anymore because of the sedation and stomach problems."
,I really like it.
,It just maybe worth it.
,the first is constipation.
,The shortness of breath was a little scary and my doctor sent me for tests to rule out heart and lung diseases and everything came out normal.
,I can barely walk up a couple of stairs without a deep burning and fatigue within my muscles.

,helping me tremendously.
,Yes I did taper off of it but it didn't matter.
,Thanks so much for telling your stories and I will keep you posted on mine.
,The only good thing I experienced was weight loss.
,In the mean time take advantage of the progress that have been made.
,"I eat very healthily, don't smoke or drink etc and was given Nexium 20mg for heartburn."
,"deffinitly helps the depression and i highly recomend it, but don't miss a dose, you'll be sorry."
,Took Nexium for 30 days then during the last week noticed some nausea only this worked good to get rid of discomfort.
,ALSO!
,It takes alot of patience and will to tough it out.
,"When I explained to my husband after a month that I could not take it anymore because it was too expensive, he INSISTED that I stay on it."
,"Due to my depression, I am always fatigued so that part doesn't bother me."
,First I was prescribed Omeprazole for my acid reflux/GERD symptoms which made my condition WORSE due to the fact that I was infected with h pylori.
,"By missing one dose of this medication, you sacrifice an entire day's worth of work, as you're completely paralyzed from thinking critically."

,Quick after giving it a solid 30 day try.
,I didn't buy that although I was getting more stressed all the time with this day long pressure on my chest.
,I thought it was the bed.
,"For me just dreaming constantly and more significantly do feel quite dizzy/light-headed, but then any time I have tried to stop any other anti-depressant I have had same reactions."
,The headache has not recurred; the acid reflux has not recurred.
,Taper?
,Very Very bad medicine for me.
,Consumer beware!
,Now after 2.5 years the side effects have become debilitating.
,Originally I was put on it with a view to ceasing after  6 months but I was terrified I'd revisit the horrible depression and anxiety so I stayed on it.
,i love Cymbalta but after reading comments i am very affraid to come off!
,Since I've had to change my diet and eating small regular meals I have lost about 4kg in a month either due to the condition or because I've changed my diet slightly.
,This is the best antidepressant I have ever used--and I have used dozens alone and in combinations concurrent with psychotherapy.
,I would highly reccomend this one!
,I must say that I was better overall on Lexapro.
,I have been on Wellbutrin before and never had any of these side effects.
,I was not prepared to endure the side effects for 2-4 weeks to see whether the drug would work or not.
,I was virile until I started Cymbalta.
,I am hoping the effects subside within the next few weeks.
,I went on after suffering from severe panic attacks for 2 months.
,It's been amazing!
,"I was prescribed Nexium to help my gastritis caused by stress, and was told it would help my GERD, so I took it."

,This drug has been very effective for me.
,I was on 60mg and at one time twice a day.
,I literally could not stop the flow but I had peed only an hour or so before.
,It is just plain poison.
,The prozac leaves your body slower and helps make the first day a little more bearable.
,"My cheek is still a bit numb, and I have a slight headache and pressure, I still have ringing in my left ear and a bit of an earache that comes and goes."
,    My libido in the past 2 months has dropped considerably as well.
,For me it's been a miracle drug.
,"Plus, I do nothing except sit on the couch and cry all day now - I don't even feel the bipolar mania ""high"" anymore in which I clean the house all day - lol, my house is a mess!"
,I have never snored in my life and my wife of 13 years now is constantly awakened by me.
,Uncertain about night and day sweats as that has been around for a decade due to menopause and a total hysterectomy.
,Then i developed an itch in my breast that became so intense it began to blister.
,I did so well my PCP took me off.
,"I have 5 kids, full-time job, and full-time college work toward masters."
,I have been weaning off this drug over 3 weeks and still feel horrible.
,Then the fatigue and dizziness came.
,It did nothing for pain.
,My FMS pain is significantly reduced on days when I am taking my full 60 mg dosage.
,"Worked good, more of an upper than paxil."
,The withdrawal sympto
,Horrible.
,"Anyway, Cymbalta is horrible when it comes to giving it to anyone with a bad heart, how many times did I write that now."
,The pain in my breast and right arm so so severe that I could barely function normally.
,I've decided I love this drug.
,After about 24 hours it does reduce the reflux pain.
,I eventually became moody and would get upset with my hubby and kids for no reason at all.
,Seemed to help for years but last year or so my heart would jump and sometimes I would get light headed and dizzy like I was going to fall over.
,My experience with Cymbalta was terrifying.
,Scared the wife to death!
,the sexual side effects are MISERABLE.
,"When I was upped to 60 mg, everything started."
,dismissed me as depressed from gaining weight.
,"Cymbalta does control anxiety a lot,and depression to a very small extent,but I can't keep taking this drug due to awful side effects."
,Good luck to you all!
,"I have had no withdrawal symptoms; other than a mild occasional headache, which excedrin took care of."
,I became paranoid that something would poke me in the eyes.
,"When it became ineffective, I switched to cymbalta."
,she was even going to put me on an antidepressant for my stomache!
,until i started reading other people's symptoms i thght i was dying.
,And at shy of $10 a pill imagine how much money is being made and why you don't get the side effect drill from the doctor when they prescribe it.
,I fall asleep easier than before.
,"However, the pain is almost completely gone."
,"It wasn't the drug's fault, it was mine."
,Since starting it 2 years ago I have left my husband of 20 years.

,I will discontinue this drug immediately!
,"may just stop working one day, and you'll begin withdrawal symptoms."
,And it's been horrible.
,I took this drug for maybe a week.
,Symptoms resolved approximately 1 week after discontinuation of Cymbalta.

,It's like the difference between a Model T and a Lexus.
,"I was at a place where I was borderline functional, and didn't want to mess with that regardless of still having major depression."

,"For the first time I am living, loving, and enjoying life--not just sitting at the sidelines watching it go by."

,"I was in a bad car accident and hurt my low back (L-5) and had undergone all kinds of injections, etc to get out of pain."
,"However, the other side effects severely hurt your quality of life."

,Even after taking it in the morning I could not sleep at night.
,"I consulted many Doctors, but the dont know how to stop the side effects of Nexium."
,I then came across this site and was shocked to see how many Nexium users were experiencing some of the exact same side effects that I was.

,"I was very scared, so my husband drove me to the ER with all 3 kids in the middle of the night."

,"I developed a bruise on my breast bone, so I'll be paying a visit to my doctor."
,Takes a few minutes but at least the information is going to the proper agency.
,I thought I was going crazy and so does my DR.
,My doctor put me on Lexapro instead.
,"After being hospitalized, my new doctor put me back on the previous AD which I can honestly say saved my life."

,Was switched to Cymbalta from Zoloft which had same side effects but worse.
,This started happening daily.
,I have been on this drug for 5.5 years.
,Not WORTH IT!
,My kids have told me I'm not so grouchy.

,Does this stop before I become bald!!!!!?????
,"I am experiencing severe constipation and every other side effect ,people would walk up to me and tell me i looked sick!i felt like something real bad was happening to me untill i read all of these comments."
,"I've been on Zoloft for years, and we tried Cymbalta because my doctor felt I had gotten too used to Zoloft and it wasn't helping as much."
,Cymbalta definitely helped with the depression.
,The benefits of Cymbalta by far out weigh the side effects.
,The withdrawl symptoms were absolutely horrible.
,I have tried many measures to get relief from the itching and pain.
,"I was amazed how quickly this drug worked, but I have also stopped drinking and eating foods that make acid reflux worse."
,He also told me the co-pay for Cymbalta is expensive.

,Do a search for Cymbalta withdrawal and see what you find!
,I have been off it for a few days now and in the evening I tend to get a bit of bloating but that's generally from fatty foods I may have consumed.
,Will not try another SSNRI for pain.

,I hade a depression and was on SSRI and Lithium when I suddenly got hypomanic.
,I have just weaned off this onto Lexapro and don't seem to have any serious side effects.
,Usually 2-3 months on aciphex would take care of it for 6 months to a year even.
,"After 2 years the ""poop-out"" came and the withdrawal was truly hell."
,"If you feel good on starter dose, don't let your doc move you up!"
,"Most of the symptoms disappeared within 24 hours, but the diarrhoea and malaise is still yet to stop."

,Still looking for the best solution for me.
,"Before my heartburn & acid reflux was so bad that I've actually went to the ER one night,because I thought I was having a heart attack which it wasn't just Chronic Heartburn & Acid Reflux from a small portion of bad eating habits and years of not realizing I was abusing over the counter drugs."
,The burning (if I forget to take it) is hugely increased over the original problem I had when I started taking Nexium five years ago.
,I just don't want that terrible pain back.
,Only test left to get is a bone-scan which my GP doesn't think is necessary yet.
,I believe an upper GI was my next step.
,Took the drug because SAMBA (warning: Do NOT use this insurer!)
,so i dont think it actually causes depression.
,How can something that seems so harmless be so bad for you?
,That was when I decided to ask about weaning off.
,It has mellowed me but this is not what I want.
,My life has been transformed.
,"Infact, I believe I become even more anxious while on this drug."

,"I am now at 60 mg. and am sleeping at night, feeling more capable every day, no longer having heart palpitations and breathing problems that I was suffering during panic attacks."
,I was on a different AD before this and the doctor switched it to this.
,I suppose once a certain amount of patients lose their minds or lives then perhaps someone will take notice and remove it from the market.
,I just started tests for a swollen pancrease and chest pain.
,At what point are you clearly just reacting to the drug?

,She decided to put me on cymbalta which was a big mistake for me.
,"I don't hurt anyone other than myself, but I need to smash something and scream."
,Depends how much they value their sex drive.
,"I have tried everything out there from tricyclics to SSRI's to MAO's to trazadone for depression with disasterous results (dysphoria, priapism, increased depression, paranoia, psychosis, etc.)"
,I also feel that the oesophagus is healing slowly though I still have pain in the throat.
,I started on 30 mg but after about 5 months decided to increase my dosage to 60 mg bc I was still having bouts of depression.
,I could barely go to the bathroom and get back to bed before feeling like my entire body was shaking and falling apart.
,I plan to stay on it at least until after my hip surgery and perhaps longer.
,You never get into a deep REM sleep.
,Upon cessation of the drug it causes autonomic disregulation do to the extreme decrease of norepinepherine on the 5-HT neurotransmitter.

,My boyfriend initially went to the doctor for acid reflux and migraines.
,I was on 60s and did a few days of 30's and quite.
,I consider myself to be a healthy person.
,"I have taken Lexapro successfully in the past and I am thinking about trying that again, regardless of the cost."
,Stopped it because of side effects and because I found a bland diet w/o the Nexium works just as well for me.
,Fast acting.
,The withdrawal side effects is worse than the starting side effects.
,Kept a clean light diet and avoided all triggering foods and it seems to be working so far.
,"I recently relocated to a new state and was having some adjustment issues and depression, I noticed my weight gain and my hair falling out as a sign of me needing help, I think that I could better manage those issues than the side effects."
,"They suppress the hormone gastrin, causing your stomach to pump acid non stop once you stop taking the drug."
,It made me decide to and plan to leave my partner for no reason!
,I told her I needed to stop the medication and she said ok just stop taking it.
,All of these crazy side effects that I read- I'm having.
,Don't take this pill!
,These are just MY experiences.

,Mostly the loss of appetite and night sweats-most nights I wake up soaking wet.
,"I was able to deal with stomach problems using Tums, Peptones when needed."
,The next morning (Monday) I took one dose of the Cymbalta.
,I kept feeling like I was going to pass out and I was so jittery with tremors.
,In the dream I jokingly threatened to punch him if he did not stop throwing stuff around.
,"I tried to taper off of cymbalta slowly, but the withdrawls were horrific."

,"Are you kidding me, my husband has lost his mind and you want to keep him on this mind-stealing drug?"
,"Generally speaking, just feeling better."

,I haven't left the house in a week and didn't realise that it was the meds until I came across this review site.

,Had flash idea when returning home - started counting pills.
,"This drug has helped the pain, helped improve my mood, and also aids in helping me to sleep."
,"I would suggest anyone who reads this to understand that everyone's body works different with medication and although these blogs provide some comfort in knowing others are going through what you are experiencing, know that everyone's experience is a little different and the main goal is weighing the benefits from the negative side effects and together with your health care provider decide what is working for you!"

,"I'm a very happy, easy going person now, whether that's from cymbalta or years of therapy."
,No ha mejorado mi depresion
,It has helped me alot.
,This is the best med I have taken and sends a message of hope to one who felt helpless.
,At the lower dosage and the numbness in the head was lessened but then I developed numbness in the face and then it started traveling throughout the body like the fibromyalgia pain did.
,I feel very well and am enjoying life.
,"My head felt like it was a balloon on a string, not attached to my body."
,I occasionally still have a bad day or two but that's normal for everyone.
,Shaking so bad I could not hold a glass.
,thought it was really working at 1st - now i'm just more tired than ever due to sleep problems with this med.
,I have taken tons of other AD's and stopped cold turkey on quite a few.

,Dreams are a very vivid.
,Going off the stuff is NOT fun.
,I'm ready to find out what I am like when not taking anything -- I have had so many over the last 3 1/2 years.
,That's the only bad part for me...no other weirdness...yet.
,"I am laying over a trash can in the kitchen throwing up uncontrollably, can't focus, cannot form a solid thought, trying to chant my abc’s since it's the only thing I can grasp."
,I knew I really didn't want to die but that didn't stop my brain from telling my body to do something about it.
,I was diagnosed with depression almost 40 years ago and have been periodically treated for it with limited success.
,I left work as soon as I felt a bit better but drove slowly.
,"It turned out to be the only one that gave me consistant relief and let me feel too, rather than be flat."
,and my pain is 99% gone.
,Finally and  with trepidation I tried cymbalta 30mg.
,"I'll be using ACV, Flax seed oil and ultra probiotic complex 25."
,I do have alot of extra added stress in my life right now.
,"I have strong personality, pain doesn't bother me alot as I've been in it for 15 or so yrs."
,I do NOT understand why the medical industry is so willing to experiment with the general public.
,"However, I only gave this med 2 weeks to work & I did not notice improvement and stopped taking it."
,for ever but I just take it if my chest burns or I cough.
,Now it never does.
,I don't recommend it.
,"No impressive mood benefits, just drawbacks: the most notable was irritability everyday with a general negative outlook and being easily angered."
,"Oddly, despite the side effects, my mood seems to be very stable, my anxiety is down, my back pain is down."
,Prilosec offered no relief.
,Alot better mood without the pain
,no real bad side effects.
,My doctor increased me to 120mg even though there's no evidence to indicate this dosage works.
,"Initially, I started Cymbalta at 60 mg/1 week then progressed to 120 mg."
,I take clonozapam 2x day to help with anxiety & panic.
,I also felt like a space cadet the entire time I was taking the drug.
,"But a chiropractor/certified dietician recommended some natural products (not cheap, but from a certified lab and readily available at compounding pharmacies that really did the trick)."
,So I cut dose back to 30 mg. No relief from side effects.
,"Within a few months I developed severe heel and foot pain, severe hip muscle fatigue and stiffness, stiffness and pain in my ribcage/trunk muscles."
,"If I sit still for long, I will get drowsy and want to go to sleep - so I try to keep active."

,"I don't know how long this will last, but its great so far."
,"I decided Cymbalta was the cause of my deteriorating health, including severe back pain, muscle weakness, and muscle and tissue inflammation in groin which has led to four MRI's 5 series of back injections for pain, and 2 CT scans."
,"I heard it was making people dense, like Lexapro started to do to me."
,"I woke up every night at 2:00 am, and couldn't go back to sleep for 2 hours."
,During the first two months it seemed to relieve the depression and anxiety but then it quit working and actually seemed to actually cause the problems along with the appearance of the terrible side effects.
,"The first two nights I took the medication, I experienced total insomnia; therefore, physician has me take Cymbalta in morning & Trazadone @bedtime."
,I'd about rather just die than take this again.
,I have never had so many anxiety attacks or anything else for that matter since I started Nexium.
,I feel like this is my last hope to get my life back again.
,"My mind raced at 100 miles a minute, but my body was exhausted, so sleep was slim."

,I was on lyrica which is a god send for me bringing the burning which had spread everywhere down from feeling burnt alive & seeing no way of living to bad sun-burn which was a massive difference.
,"the >95% who don't have the bad side effects don't come on this board, so that's why we see a disproportionate amount of negative posts."
,"I'm not able or motivated to do anything, since all I can think about is how messed up I feel and how hard it is to focus on anything and the strain of seeing straight is a constant distraction."
,I am so glad I did it this way.
,Taking this drug was the woarst thing I have ever experienced.
,To come off I took a flerixil and xanax instead of the cymbalta last night.
,"Each worked, but had their own problems (look for other 41 year old comments posted on 8/30/09 on this site for my issues with those drugs)."
,I have no history of mania so it was scary.
,Having said all this it has only been 2days.

,I also have lupus and this drug seems to help with the extreme fatigue I have felt for the past 4 years.
,I am worried about the depression returning... time will tell
,"However, the lower dosage did the trick and, almost immediately, he started getting his mind back."
,After 7 weeks side effects are GONE.
,In fact the pain seems to be getting worse.
,If not I may start my own.
,"When I was decreasing the dosage from 90mg to 60mg to 30mg I experienced nausea, dizziness, migraine-like headaches, rapid heartbeat, trembling and generally walked around for two weeks feeling like I had the flu (I didn't)."
,Drug.
,"Had it not been for my extremely understanding and supportive husband, and finding another site (check out healtdiaries.com for more Cymbalta info."
,Doctors should be educated on the side effects.
,"My dr. warned that I could have a ""fuzzy"" feeling for a couple weeks so we will see if it gets better."
,I am very pleased.
,"I had been weening myself off this drug when I went to her, and my sex drive IS improving."
,Started out with what we thought was a yeast infection.
,I slept till 3 pm today and didn't go to work.
,the side effect that has been by far the worse has been grinding my teeth at night and clenching my jaw during the day.
,But this has been horrible.
,"The loss of appetite and weight loss was one of the main side effects I had, I am already underweight, and losing weight isn't good for me"
,The doctor put me on a 30mlg dose with the idea of increasing me to 60mlg.
,I literally took my first pill about 12 hours ago.
,All my docs insist that not taking it will increase the potential of getting something awful.
,"However, after around 11 months of use I started to experience brain zaps and migraines on a weekly basis, and especially if I delayed taking it (sleeping in had it's consequences)."
,The positives far outweigh the side effects.
,I do not have the crazy hunger like I did with Remeron.
,I hope this damage will heal and wonder what unseen damage has been done.
,"I started to feel extremely ill (nauseous, dizzy, confused) and looked at the bottle closer and saw it was 60 mg."
,TOTALLY out of character for me!
,This medication so far hasn't been the best.
,i either wanna go out or stay in bed.
,"Everything was fine in the first round, and then I waited around and didn't take it for a couple of days."
,this is my second time on this first time quit cold turkey not to may problems other than those silly brain zaps.
,it knocked me off my feet
,"Ever since I have been on it, I have not had one good night sleep."
,I have taken Lexapro and Prozac in the past with numerous side effects; very minimal with Cymbalta.
,Took this following a redo of a fundiplication -- the first one was done incorrectely.
,"so i stopped taking this medication as of today, and i am so happy that i will not have to experience this any more."
,"My neurotransmitters function the way they are supposed to when my stomach is full, my brain gets the message and I feel full!!"
,"Was on Lexapro for years, then tried Zoloft which did nothing."
,It really has saved my life.
,This drug makes me sick.
True,"If I eat much of anything in the morning while I still have the mild nausea I will get diarrhea, otherwise I have had some mild constipation but that usually only makes me take a little longer in the bathroom so I moved some books in there for reading (reading has always been difficult because of the lack of interest, and excessive daytime sleepiness that would cause me to fall asleep repeatedly and become disoriented)."
,This med.
,Thank you so much for this site and thank every one that is posting here.
,Cymbalta has been great.
,I can't believe such a simple fix has not been common knowlege!
,It was THE MIRACLE PILL.
,"Long term use was not studied enough, in her opinion."
,I seem to be more weepy (crying easily) during pms as well.
,Not at maximum dose yet so not sure if it will help with pain in the long run.
,I was also able to stop taking my migraine preventative (Topamax) and am experiencing less anxiety.
,He then switched me to prozac.
,"I am on a drug that makes me feel great, my moods are evened out, no weight gain, and I can enjoy sex!"
,Getting off of it was sheer HELL.
,The other complaint is the withdrawal.
,Re-learn how and why your thoughts affect your mood.
,"This has been pretty effective in decreasing my anxiety(health anxiety), but I fear I will go crazy without adequate sleep."
,It took me 5-6 days to come down from my hypomania.
,It works wonders.
,"I've had stress test, full body shunt study, breathing test."
,"I have never experienced anything like the withdrawl I went through it was crazy, but like I said I only had the symptoms once a day for about an hour or so and once I threw up I was fine and went about my day."
,"All in all, this drug works better than any other that I've taken for headaches and I've taken just about all of them plus tried every natural treatment there is."
,I would not suggest this med to anyone who has remaining choices.
,I did not care if I died.
,"the first antidepressant I've taken that actually seems to be helping somewhat, at least in combination with other meds, after prozac, celexa, wellbutrin, etc it was a relief to have something that seemed to cause some improvement, although the side effects nearly caused me to quit before there were any beneficial effects"
,Other days he is so manic he can't stop moving.
,My doctor brought me down to 30 mg every day for 2 weeks and then every other day.
,After taking this for about a month I was able to start driving again.
,When I started with the medicine it was pretty new and I guess they did not know about the withdrawal side effects.
,Severe depression has occurred again and came to a head last night.
,Cymbalta has really helped with my general anxiety.
,I have had ovarian cancer tests because of the bloating and had to leave work today because of severe dizzyness and tingling in my left arm.
,it can be deadly if u ask me.
,I sometimes supplement with Lexapro 20mg if my depression or anxiety increases for more than a couple of weeks.
,"Finally, in desperation, tried accupuncture and got relief!"
,It makes me sick when I stop taking it and also after I am taking it for a while.
,I can only pray that I and hopefully all of you feel better soon.
,I have also tried Rozerem for last two days with Cymbalt
,he says very inappropriate things.
,This medicine is a real blessing to me.
,I was weaning off as dr ordered but still not quite there.
,Thank you :)
,I have prescribed this for years and had no idea what coming off of this med could potentially do.
,It is way too strong for me.
